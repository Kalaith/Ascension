## Method
- Evidence confidence scale:
- `High`: direct primary records, multi-source corroboration, or direct system readouts.
- `Medium`: strong witness testimony and/or partial records with plausible gaps.
- `Low`: plausible interpretation with limited direct corroboration.

## Claims Matrix

### HTL-001
- Official Narrative: Ascension access is bloodline-exclusive by nature.
- Recovered Evidence: Transfer pathways were "never bloodline-exclusive" and were made exclusive by policy; old temple doctrine frames worthiness as discipline under pressure, not blood purity.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Regime doctrine used bloodline gating while recovered records show compatibility/discipline model.
- Operational Impact: Invalidates lineage legitimacy claims and supports open-consent training reform.
- Source Lines: 1847, 3458, 3462, 3466, 3468, 5036

### HTL-002
- Official Narrative: Current single-line city ritual is the original ascension method.
- Recovered Evidence: Temple paired-altar architecture and activation show original ritual was cooperative/distributed; single-line model came later via rewritten access rules.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Physical legacy interfaces conflict with city doctrine and ritual monopoly.
- Operational Impact: Justifies redesign toward distributed governance and shared training.
- Source Lines: 1889, 1895, 1903, 1917, 2331, 2477

### HTL-003
- Official Narrative: Ksena failed ritual due to incapacity/defect.
- Recovered Evidence: She was expelled for resisting alignment lock; classified as useful unknown variable, not simple failure.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: "Failure" label was political framing to preserve control narrative.
- Operational Impact: Reclassifies incomplete ascension as a meaningful technical state, not disqualification.
- Source Lines: 450, 1833, 1839, 3454

### HTL-004
- Official Narrative: Crystal system is purely protective and necessary as implemented.
- Recovered Evidence: Core lattice includes hidden protocols: selective drain rates, lineage filters, command imprint, succession architecture.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Protection and governance were fused to enforce obedience and hierarchy.
- Operational Impact: Supports legal/technical separation of defense systems from command authority.
- Source Lines: 3312, 3316, 4066, 4068, 4070, 4076, 4084, 4106

### HTL-005
- Official Narrative: Barrier is neutral public safety infrastructure.
- Recovered Evidence: Barrier operation was coupled to coercive ritual architecture and edited-history governance; post-collapse testimony describes both protection and imprisonment.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Public safety function existed, but with embedded social control and information captivity.
- Operational Impact: Requires transparent oversight for any future high-power civic infrastructure.
- Source Lines: 4054, 4056, 4084, 4533, 4905, 4985

### HTL-006
- Official Narrative: Council authority is merit-based continuity from war leadership.
- Recovered Evidence: Post-war split was governance vs monopoly; control faction won and rewrote systems from enhancement into governance mechanism.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Continuity claim conceals an explicit political capture event.
- Operational Impact: Grounds legitimacy transfer to mixed councils, audits, and public logs.
- Source Lines: 1831, 2209, 2331, 3470, 5007, 5018

### HTL-007
- Official Narrative: Ritual conditioning and enforcement are lawful, bounded, and non-abusive.
- Recovered Evidence: Hidden detention chamber, draining shackles, and governor-node keyed imprisonment demonstrate covert abuse infrastructure.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Coercive tools operated outside transparent judicial controls.
- Operational Impact: Necessitates independent incident review and prohibition of private ritual command.
- Source Lines: 3328, 3340, 3344, 3412, 5009, 5017

### HTL-008
- Official Narrative: City and tribal lines are inherently separate in origin and ascension potential.
- Recovered Evidence: Archive and oral records show shared founders, integrated lines, and broader ascendant potential across populations.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Separation was policy-driven and historically curated.
- Operational Impact: Supports inclusive training eligibility and anti-supremacy education.
- Source Lines: 2177, 2187, 2203, 2223, 2331, 3774

### HTL-009
- Official Narrative: Forced guidance is required for social stability and military readiness.
- Recovered Evidence: Voluntary cohorts and controlled demonstrations with independent witnesses achieved stable outcomes outside coercive model.
- Confidence Level: Medium
- Contradictions: Stability appears achievable via discipline + transparency rather than compulsion.
- Operational Impact: Supports informed-consent ascension policy and civilian veto mechanisms.
- Source Lines: 2585, 2621, 3801, 3870, 3912, 5015

### HTL-010
- Official Narrative: Reproductive and lineage policy reflected sacred tradition.
- Recovered Evidence: Publicly released files describe birth-ratio controls, pairing restrictions, and access gates disguised as tradition.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: "Tradition" functioned as an administrative control mask.
- Operational Impact: Requires ongoing hearings, restitution policy, and archival transparency.
- Source Lines: 5026, 5028, 5030, 5032, 5034

### HTL-011
- Official Narrative: Ascension is only a tactical power upgrade.
- Recovered Evidence: Joint medical-science brief confirms biological divergence and century-scale lifespan implications.
- Confidence Level: High
- Contradictions: Governance risk (office capture / bottlenecks) is structural, not incidental.
- Operational Impact: Justifies term reauthorization and anti-entrenchment law.
- Source Lines: 4941, 4943

### HTL-012
- Official Narrative: Compulsions and conditioned obedience are natural ascendant discipline.
- Recovered Evidence: When the control lattice collapsed, conditioned fighters showed abrupt break in compulsive behavior.
- Confidence Level: Medium
- Contradictions: Suggests imposed control layer rather than purely voluntary internal discipline.
- Operational Impact: Prioritize trauma care, memory reliability review, and accountability distinctions.
- Source Lines: 4825, 4869, 5005
