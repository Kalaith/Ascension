## Scope
- In scope: ritual-era physical and control infrastructure directly tied to ascension, command, and barrier function.
- Out of scope: civilian district architecture not tied to ritual systems.

## System Overview
Ascension infrastructure is a coupled network of ritual interfaces, crystal control nodes, and transfer channels. In canon, the regime-era system overlays coercive command logic onto older communal infrastructure.

Three functional layers:
- Interface layer: where people interact (altars, temple interfaces, ritual pedestal).
- Control layer: where policy/command logic is embedded (core lattice, governor node behavior).
- Distribution layer: where power flow is routed (barrier shell feed lines, channel synchronization cycles).

## Node Catalog

### 1) Core Ritual Crystal (Ritual District Core Chamber)
- Type: Central crystal-lattice node.
- Canon function: runs both barrier and ritual processing through a shared lattice.
- Physical behavior: hidden below floor when dormant, rises on wall-trigger; seated in ring cradle.
- Embedded logic observed: command imprint, discriminatory draw, lineage-gated behavior, succession architecture.
- Key hazard: high accumulated charge; uncontrolled destruction risks massive regional discharge.
- End-state in story: pedestal destroyed, lattice collapsed, barrier removed.

### 2) Core Chamber Pedestal and Access Mechanism
- Type: Mechanical-ritual deployment platform.
- Canon function: exposes core crystal for ritual use and calibration.
- Access path: concealed trigger plate and controlled chamber entry.
- Security model: layered guard presence and controlled district routing.
- Operational note: ceremonial posture hid practical vulnerabilities during shift transitions.

### 3) Governor Node (Red Crystal Regulator Gem)
- Type: Secondary control crystal.
- Canon function: powers restraint/drain circuits; separate from core lattice but integrated with command practices.
- Confirmed use: keyed shackles in detention chamber; required for prisoner release sequence.
- Handling risk: dangerous under direct skin contact; wrapping/insulation used during extraction.
- Control significance: tactical enforcement tool, not just a passive regulator.

### 4) Secret Detention Restraint Circuit
- Type: Coercive sub-system.
- Canon function: drains ascendants through contact shackles; maintains covert imprisonment.
- Entry requirement: ascendant signature gate in hidden corridor.
- Dependency: red governor node lock interaction required for safe release.
- Abuse profile: covert long-duration incapacitation under command authority.

### 5) Paired Altar Temple Interface (Legacy System)
- Type: Legacy dual-interface ascension station.
- Canon function: cooperative activation via paired hand depressions; reopens transfer pathways.
- Output behavior: synchronized pulse, sequence memory transfer, shared activation effects.
- Proven outcomes: Ksena shows incomplete-state stabilization with added strain cost; Alcuin gains ignition pathway activation from non-ascended baseline.
- Historical implication: original system was paired/distributed, later rewritten into single-line control.

### 6) Hidden Temple Station and Relay Data Network
- Type: Legacy archival/control support nodes.
- Canon function: map projection, site-link intelligence, sequence records access.
- Evidence value: confirms larger infrastructure network beyond official doctrine.
- Operational use: route intelligence, cross-site coordination, planning for anti-regime operations.

## Access and Signature Requirements

Observed gate classes:
- Public ritual access under city protocol for candidates.
- Ascendant-signature-locked internal gates for restricted chambers.
- Cooperative dual-contact requirements at paired legacy altars.

Important constraint:
- Some temple interfaces cannot be used by unascended intermediaries.
- Half-awakened ascendants can create new access entry points for network actors.

## Power Flow and Timing Characteristics

Confirmed characteristics:
- Core cycle has narrow rewrite window (four seconds per cycle in the documented operation).
- Multi-operator synchronization is required for safe control-logic rewrite.
- Missed timing in active channels can cause catastrophic material failure.

Transfer architecture:
- Legacy model supports anchor/receiver patterns and communal synchronization.
- Regime model biases extraction/control outcomes using embedded policy logic.

## Failure and Hazard Profile

Primary hazards:
- Channel overload and seam-closure lethality during mistimed operations.
- Command-loop recapture when original master signatures are recognized.
- Coercive cognitive pressure through ritual alignment channels.
- High-energy crystal rupture risks at continental scale if handled improperly.

Secondary hazards:
- Security overconfidence around ceremonial zones.
- Hidden enforcement circuits outside formal public governance.

## Regime Manipulation Layer (Technical Summary)

Documented manipulations:
- Selective drain rates.
- Lineage filters and conduit thresholds by bloodline.
- Differential channel stripping patterns.
- Command imprint architecture masked as ritual necessity.

Net effect:
- Infrastructure functioned as governance enforcement, not only defense or ascension enablement.

## Post-Collapse Infrastructure Direction

Canonical transition requirements implied by events and reforms:
- Remove private command authority over ritual systems.
- Move to multi-signature control for critical ritual access.
- Require informed consent for ascension procedures.
- Enforce public logging and independent review for ritual incidents.

Recommended documentation follow-on:
- Full network map with node dependencies.
- Standard operating limits per node type.
- Recovery protocol library for damaged or legacy-biased nodes.

## Open Unknowns
- Exact count and status of surviving legacy nodes after core collapse.
- Which coercive subroutines persist outside destroyed core infrastructure.
- Long-term stability of replacement ritual governance without core-lattice dependency.
- Whether all paired sites share identical compatibility thresholds.
