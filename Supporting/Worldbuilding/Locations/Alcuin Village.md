# Alcuin Village

## What It Is
- Tribal village outside city control where Ksena and Alcuin build trust before exile.

## What We Know
- Economy tied to forced extraction dynamics with the city (framed as protection payments).
- Community life is practical, social, and less ritual-bureaucratic than the city.
- Keeps older traditions and field knowledge (tracking, prayer circles, survival methods).

## Major Events Here
- Pre-ritual interactions between Ksena and Alcuin.
- Village elders compelled into exile transfer protocol.
- Later chapter: Alcuin returns; village debates limited, cautious support rather than mass commitment.

## End-State
- Village leadership joins wider reform process gradually, with armed caution and negotiated coordination.
