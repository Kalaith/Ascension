# City of Flame

## What It Is
- Ksena's home city and the main seat of crystal-based ritual governance before the regime collapse.
- Highly ordered, surveilled, and structured around bells, checkpoints, and formal role assignments.

## What We Know
- Physical character: polished stone, curated gardens, strict lane and district control, memorial spaces, and a central ritual complex.
- Social order: obedience-first culture; public behavior and movement are heavily managed.
- Political role: elders and ritual authority govern through crystal systems and controlled ascension processes.
- Family power center: Ksena's parents and Kalani hold influence in its command structure.

## Major Events Here
- Ksena's ritual failure and tribunal sentence of external exile.
- Discovery that crystal governance is effectively a control architecture, not neutral protection.
- Final internal conflict that ends elder crystal command.

## End-State
- Barrier is removed.
- Governance shifts to transitional, mixed representation with reforms and public accountability structures.
