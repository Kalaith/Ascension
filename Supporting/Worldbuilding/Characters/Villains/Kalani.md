Key Moments:

- Dies during late-stage conflict after catastrophic overreach.
Major Interactions:
- Ksena: central emotional and ideological antagonist relationship.
- Grandmother and coalition teams: repeated combat opposition.
- Hale/Kirk operations: containment and response priority target.
Final-Alignment Notes:

- After Ascension: Pale clear skin, bright luminous eyes, severe angelic-elf-like facial structure, visually alien and intimidating.
- Visual Markers: Flame presentation is unusually stable, sharp-edged, and aggressive.
- Presence: Cold confidence with intermittent volatility, especially around Ksena.

Psychology and Temperament:
- Core Drives: Superiority, control, and status validation.
- Internal Conflict: Residual family attachment repeatedly overridden by ambition and rivalry.

Capabilities:
- Power Profile: High lethality, strong aerial mobility, heavy strike capacity.
- Combat/Field: Aggressive pressure tactics, decisive burst attacks, low de-escalation tolerance.

Narrative Function:
- Personalizes the cost of regime conditioning by turning sisterhood into ideological war.
