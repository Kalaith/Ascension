Final Alignment: Villain (tragic enforcer)
Description:
- Ksena's older sister; transformed early by city ascension doctrine and command conditioning.
- Highly lethal ascendant whose rivalry, pride, and trauma repeatedly override family ties.
Key Moments:
- Appears as regime-aligned enforcer during early suppression events.
- Faces multiple opportunities to stand down or defect but rejects each in favor of dominance.
- Escalates into direct hostile actions against Ksena and coalition operations.
- Dies during late-stage conflict after choosing catastrophic overreach while redemption is still available.
Major Interactions:
- Ksena: central emotional and ideological antagonist relationship.
- Theron: authority figure whose system and incentives shape her worst choices.
- Grandmother and coalition teams: repeated combat opposition.
- Hale/Kirk operations: containment and response priority target.
Final-Alignment Notes:
- Final posture is destructive and anti-reconciliation, but framed as a preventable tragedy rather than pure monster turn.
