## Deep Dive

Detailed Description:
- Physical Profile: Native non-human (ascended line), field-athletic and disciplined.
- Before Ascension: Tanned skin, dark hair, dark eyes, wiry hunter build (canon rule).
- After Ascension: Pale clear skin, bright luminous eyes, sharpened foreign facial symmetry, still rugged but distinctly non-human in presence.
- Visual Markers: Weathered hands, controlled breath discipline, efficient movement economy (inferred).
- Presence: Quiet, observant, low-ego authority that people trust quickly.

Psychology and Temperament:
- Core Drives: Protection, reliability, and practical outcomes over ideology.
- Internal Conflict: Fear of losing Ksena versus need to support her autonomy and risk choices.
- Leadership Style: Decentralized field command, clear signals, and fallback-first planning.

Capabilities:
- Power Profile: Cleaner precision lines than most peers; endurance dips in prolonged output chains.
- Combat/Field: Tracking, route reading, ambush response, and risk triage.
- Strategic Value: Stabilizes group decisions when emotional stakes spike.

Narrative Function:
- Serves as moral ballast and operational continuity through regime collapse.
