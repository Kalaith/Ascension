Final Alignment: Main protagonist (anti-regime coalition)

Description:
- Sixteen-year-old city-born candidate raised inside elite power but with limited personal belonging.
- Younger sibling in a family where older sisters ascended before her, intensifying isolation and comparison pressure.
- Initially under-watched due to nepotism and assumptions of low threat.
- Incomplete early ascension leaves her unstable at first, then uniquely capable of disrupting command-conditioned systems.

Key Moments:
- Fails ritual in the crystal hall and is recast by leadership as both anomaly and tracking opportunity.
- Forced into exile framework that doubles as a regime probe for outside resistance links.
- Builds alliances across villages, archives, and human contact teams.
- Discovers evidence that ascension was communal before elite capture.
- Leads operations that expose regime crimes and break crystal command infrastructure.
- Witnesses Kalani's final collapse after repeated failed off-ramps to de-escalation.

Major Interactions:
- Alcuin: closest partner, tactical and emotional anchor.
- Kalani: sister conflict moving from fear/hope to lethal opposition with late tragedy.
- Theron (father): true strategic antagonist using council structure as facade.
- Kirk and Hale: off-world alliance enabling intel, logistics, and coordinated operations.
- Grandmother: core mentor in discipline, legitimacy, and reconstruction.

Final-Alignment Notes:
- Ends as a foundational leader in rebuilding governance with shared civilian authority.
## Deep Dive

Detailed Description:
- Physical Profile: Native non-human (ascended line), foreign/ethereal presentation.
- Before Ascension: Tanned skin, dark hair, dark eyes, hunter-gatherer practical build and styling (canon rule).
- After Ascension: Pale clear skin, bright luminous eyes (blue-red range), strikingly attractive angular features, visibly non-human/otherworldly presence.
- Visual Markers: Keeps functional clothing over decorative dress post-banishment; movement favors readiness over ceremony (inferred).
- Presence: Intense focus under pressure, visible hesitation only in family-linked confrontations (inferred).

Psychology and Temperament:
- Core Drives: Autonomy, truth recovery, civilian protection, and refusal of inherited coercion.
- Internal Conflict: Rage response versus precision control; belonging to family versus opposing their system.
- Leadership Style: Learns to lead by consent, transparency, and shared risk rather than command fear.

Capabilities:
- Power Profile: High raw output with early instability; later strong channel shaping and tactical adaptation.
- Combat/Field: Fast learner in mixed-team operations, strong under deteriorating conditions.
- Strategic Value: Unique link between incomplete ascension state and restoration-era ritual mechanics.

Narrative Function:
- Embodies the transition from survival protagonist to systems-level reform leader.
