Final Alignment: Main protagonist (anti-regime coalition)

Description:
- Sixteen-year-old city-born candidate who rejects inherited control.
- Incomplete early ascension leaves her unstable at first, then uniquely capable of unlocking older distributed ascension methods.
- Driven by conscience, protection of civilians, and truth about stolen ritual history.

Key Moments:
- Fails ritual in the crystal hall and is sentenced to banishment.
- Builds alliances across villages, archives, and human contact teams.
- Discovers historical evidence that ascension was communal before elite capture.
- Leads operations that expose regime crimes and break crystal command infrastructure.
- Confronts Kalani repeatedly and survives final city-scale collapse.

Major Interactions:
- Alcuin: closest partner, tactical and emotional anchor.
- Kalani: sister conflict that shifts from fear/hope to open lethal opposition.
- Kirk and Hale: critical off-world alliance enabling intel, logistics, and coordinated operations.
- Grandmother: core mentor in discipline, legitimacy, and reconstruction.

Final-Alignment Notes:
- Ends as a foundational leader in rebuilding governance with shared civilian authority.
## Deep Dive

Detailed Description:
- Physical Profile: Native non-human (ascended line), foreign/ethereal presentation.
- Before Ascension: Tanned skin, dark hair, dark eyes, hunter-gatherer practical build and styling (canon rule).
- After Ascension: Pale clear skin, bright luminous eyes (blue-red range), strikingly attractive angular features, visibly non-human/otherworldly presence.
- Visual Markers: Keeps functional clothing over decorative dress post-banishment; movement favors readiness over ceremony (inferred).
- Presence: Intense focus under pressure, visible hesitation only in family-linked confrontations (inferred).

Psychology and Temperament:
- Core Drives: Autonomy, truth recovery, civilian protection, and refusal of inherited coercion.
- Internal Conflict: Rage response versus precision control; belonging to family versus opposing their system.
- Leadership Style: Learns to lead by consent, transparency, and shared risk rather than command fear.

Capabilities:
- Power Profile: High raw output with early instability; later strong channel shaping and tactical adaptation.
- Combat/Field: Fast learner in mixed-team operations, strong under deteriorating conditions.
- Strategic Value: Unique link between incomplete ascension state and restoration-era ritual mechanics.

Narrative Function:
- Embodies the transition from survival protagonist to systems-level reform leader.
