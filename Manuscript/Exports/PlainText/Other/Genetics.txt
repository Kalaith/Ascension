The head researcher said he had news, he seemed quite excited, the General had never seen him this excited before, whatever the news was it must be big enough to rattle his top researcher, coming to his room the general knocked on the door
Come in! The ehad research was there in an instant ready to open the door, he must be really excited
You said you had news, whats so imporant that you wanted to have a meeting this urgently?
We have been studing the population and including the ascendant 
So what news do you have about it?
Well, have a seat, the scientist went over to his table and poured a drink for him and the general
I am still on duty
Relax I think you will need a drink after you listen to what I have to say
Bring the drink over and placing it infront of the genral he had oppsite and had a mouthful while the general stared him down
Both the ascendant and normal population have a simliar structure, and we spent alot of time when we had the crystal and the changes in the two aliens you brught aborb, and the results are just astouding
The scienists had anough mouthful before continuing
As far as we can tell, when one of them becomes ascendant its a bit like there genes have been split and internally they become like a fusion reactor like the sun, constatly general heat, which is why they are draped in flame

It seems that before the war the soceity was heavily relgious, and they found a way to focus there combined energy and basically use that on the target to force there atoms to split and go into fusion generating energy, the enegry they produce also replaces most of their bodily functions and as far as we can tell there live span would be about the same as a new born sun
The generals wide widened at that, and he grabbed his drink and had a sip
So your telling me that this race of ascendant is basiclly an incarnation of sun and they like live for a few billion years
Yes thats about right, each one of them has about the same strenght as every weapon on earth, if they fully developed their powers they could wipe a planet out at a whim
This makes them alot more dangeous we expected, and we have currently made a enemy of the majrity of their population
This is where the crystal comes in, the crystal does a few things but I can tell you they did not build it, that crystal was created but not by them
If they didn’t who did? Their original agreesors, it seems the crystal was designed to aborb and store there powers, when they use the crystal to unlock their acession it actually supresses their abilities, still dangerous mind you, but not beyond our realm of control.

Why would they use it? 
Well it seems as well as suppressing it also rewrites parts of the brain basically turning them into slaves, but I doubt they understand it, and it seems it was to late to save the creatures that attacked them
Likley the first of the asnced didn’t use it, they found it afterwards and decided to use it, thats likley why there civilization has become stagnant, they are waiting for orders from masters that do not exist
Do you have any more information on these enemies?
Yes, we think we might even know the direction they came from, although our initial studies have said the invasion was more an accident we think it was alot like our ship designed for long term travel through space and they made a mistake, I would say it would take our ship a couple of thousand years to reach them
That far huh the general said, so I doubt they are going to come back any time soon, if they even know what happened
With the control is there any way we could possibily gain control over it?
I thought you might ask, I looked into it but I do not think so, not with our current technology, it seems to be an advanced version of quantum comptuing, we can barly see it never alone take control over it, I think the invanders that attacked scientifically were much futher ahead of us, its no wonder they would have won, the population down there has some interesting technlogy, I would love to study their city more, I was able to spent some time in the city but the mayor was hestiate on reveling to much, to be honest I think his more dangerous the ascendant right now, his bring back their technology they havn’t used for over a thousand of years, but doesn’t fully understand it, so things could go wrong.
Ill ask Kirk to keep an eye on him, going back to the topic before, do you know what Ksena was unable to be controlled by the crystal, from what I heard it backfired.
That one is interesting, the children of ascendant need to have basically there cells hmm shaken, I do not know if that ritual they talked about would have done anything, her brain chemistry could be diffrent from normal, but I would say it was an invert reaction from another one of the ascended, but who or why I can’t say, she was just really lucky.

If we have had arrived and she was not their to meet kirk, I think we would have had to assume the war was already loss and already be on the way home.
Good luck for us, at least we will have plenty to take back with us, should make the people happy
The scientist nodded, I am a little worried about the future thought, as I said the crystak supressed the powers, but now there is a dozen ascendant who where not under the control of it, and the number is going to start growing, eventually the whole population could be ascendaned
The general nodded, the officals on earth wouldn’t like that
In a way it might have been better if we not involved now the planet poses a future risk to earth
Do you have any suggestions?
Well the ship contains a fussion reactor of its own, I think if we could capture them we would be able to hold them
They are living beings we can’t do that
I know, just saying you did ask
The general nodded, well Ksena is currently in charge and as you said they live for along time so as long as she remains in charge I think we could maintain a positive realtionship
The scinetist nodded, we can see this but I worry how it will go down on earth, in a way these aliens are the epitome of super hero in powers compared to humans.
Could the same procedure be done on humans? 
No I do not think so, biologoically compared the aliens here we are developed very diffrently, I do not know how they control their powers, but I think if the same thing was done to a human, they would just explode
Distreetly the general coughed as you know Kirk and one of the natives are very attached, is there any possiability of something happening there?
The research looked up at the genral who actually looked like he might be blushing
Well as I said our makeup is completly diffrent, so I do not think we would be compadbilite, its surpsing that the act is similiar between our two races
And we do know its possible for a non ascendant to get an ascdant prgenat
We do the general piped up
Yes Ksena was pregant before the fnal ritual, we did a test after she was on board and the child looks to be healthy, we think since they are so similar at least the females can still breed with the males, I would estimate though that a female non ascendant would be able to get pregant by an ascedant male, it may be possible, but the mother wouldn’t have the natural power
Didn’t you say Ksena got pregant? 
Yes but she was a dormant ascedant so her body is still able to give birth to another dormant ascendant as well.
