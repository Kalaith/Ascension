Ksena found her eyes wondered to Alcuin without her thinking, more often she was comfortable, they had grew up together and she had never felt this way, but now that the two were alone and traveling together, they where both exiled, Ksena smiled as Alcuin grabbed handfuls of wood for the fire, when Alcuin glanced in her direction she shook her head, she shouldn’t be having such thoughts, but her eyes wondered back to him as soon as stopped thinking about it.

Alcuin felt her eyes on him, they always seem to be on him latently, it made him nervous, his future a week ago was easy, he was raised in the tribe one day he would marry, maybe Estele she had the most interest in him, a couple of children..but now it was alone with Ksena exiled alongside her, that future didn’t exist anymore, which meant his attraction towards her grew, but at the same time he still resentful that his future had been stolen away, and now..what did he want, her no he would settle his business with her and find a new tribe, one further away from the city, so he has less to do with the ascendant the better, but that still didn’t do much to stop that quiver of longing as he remained stuck in her gaze.
