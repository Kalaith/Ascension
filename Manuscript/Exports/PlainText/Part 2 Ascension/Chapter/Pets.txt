They could see it prowling around outside their camp. It was a cat; it went hunting for food at night; they were rare, Ksena or Alcuin had never seen one in person before, Ksena had only seen them in books, they added onto the fire trying to scare it away, but as the fire grew it crawled in closer, they could clearly see its bright orange fur, scarlet in the fires ruddy glow
They needed to do something else. It was getting closer as it circled them. Ksena called forth her power, but as she did so, the cat’s eyes seem to spark and its attention was centered on Ksena.
it rushed her, it was nimble and quickly darted around Alcuin and launching itself at Ksena, Ksena had just got this power and it was already being tested to defend herself, instead of a tiny fireball to knock the cat back, Ksena flung nearly everything she had at the cat, this close it would be an explosion and being this close Ksena realized she made a mistake as soon as her power left her fingertips, the fireball hit the cat midair and surrounded the cat completely in flames, Ksena collapsed onto one knee from exhaustion as her powers whirled around the cat, she waited for the explosion but it didn't happen, even as Alcuin tried to cover themselves knowing they were to close.
Instead, the cat leap in front of her out of the fire. The cat was still on fire, but it was the same as a full ascension outfit made of living flame. The cat wore the flame as a coat of amour; the explosion dissipated after the cat left it, leaving Ksena and Alcuin alone with the cat that was now preening itself sitting between them
