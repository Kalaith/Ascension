if the humans didn't level the city, what did, the only one that had enough power other than the humans was her own people, but they wouldn't do something like this, they have no reason to and especially how the city was destroyed completely; it made little sense. It must have been the humans Alcuin was lying, he had to be. They were the aliens on this planet. Maybe another group of humans had done the attack.
