The war started without warning, one day it was peaceful and explosions and death has they invaded, we had weapons but they did nothing, our scientist worked day and nights, trying to come up with a solution, but in the end they didn’t find a solution, the solution came from somewhere more basic but more profound, we had long maintained our beliefs and with the coming end of the world more and more attention was focused onto it, they where like heroes or fanatics depending on who was looking, they would go from temple to temple and having our people pray and worship them, I was there the first time a true ascended, they had prayed at nearly every temple in the country, and at this there final temple a miracle happened, as I watched and prayed, flames started to form around there body, which made everyone pray even harder, this was something different and everyone knew it, the flames never went out, but when they no longer blinded me I saw him, dressed in flame,  floating in the air, even his appearance was changed, his body taking on the appearance of the divine” ?????
He was the first in our army of god, where our previous weapons had done nothing, he could stop an offense with a single wave of his hand, the enemy would explode in holy flames, others came after him, and soon we weren’t just pushing them back, we were winning, if this is where the story ended, it would have been wonderful, but it was not the case, driven into a corner our enemy unleashed hell, it was to much, they not only attacked on the ground but filled our skies, the enemy seemed desperate, as if they had to win, our heroes beat them but it had come at a cost, all but the capital had been destroyed, our cities and towns laid in ruins.
Eventually our forces corner the enemy leader on our world, and in that final battle we had come out as the victors

But the ascended left us, our people where broken and the ascended nowhere to be found, with all our cities destroyed and millions killed our people where soon reverted back to the hunters of old, eventually we found the ascended had built a new city and locked themselves away in it, why we don't know
We were now alone in a destroyed world and our holy army had left us instead of guiding us through this troubled time.

I write down these memoirs in some hope a small part of the truth would be known, I fear for our people with our hearts removed what hope is there is the future.
