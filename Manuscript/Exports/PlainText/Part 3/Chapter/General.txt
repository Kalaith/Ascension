The general went over his plans multiple times, was this a mistake to get involved in he thought to himself, their mission had been to respond to a distress beacon, and see if they can be of help in either diplomacy or combat.
The problem was they arrived to late for the war that had ended over a thousand years ago, and the current fight was closer to a civil war, should they be involved in it, the current situation was, after the war the people on the planet had split into two factions, one faction was the reason the war went in their favor, but after-wards they waged war on their own people and by the end of it they won and civilization collapsed for the original species, the winner went off and mostly stayed in their city, but they did take steps to control the population and more one report of mass genocide.
His own people had failed to make contact with the race for any sort of negotiation, and they had come under attack by them more once.

By siding with the oppressed side, if they helped them win eventually they would raise their technology back up to space, the other side seem content to stay in there city.
If they just let the other people live their lives there wouldn’t be a problem, but the leadership of the city seemed bent on having it there way.

It was a difficult decision for the general, at least the female Ksena had been understanding, it was her people that was affected and she understood his concerns, but the decision was the general’s and in this case he had decided to side with Ksena, the thing that moved him was the fact that the people in the city were being controlled by a few select individuals, if the general could help Ksena oust the current leadership, that would be enough what they did after that is there decision

The other factor was the fact that it was not a full scale war, just a distraction, give Ksena and her people time to implement their plan for removing the control, so in terms of life's loss, it will be zero, he wasn’t going to fight to kill and he would do his best to make sure none of his own people fell either

The plan was quite simple, there barrier was quiet impervious, but a light barrage on one side to distract from the team entering the other side, and full retreat hopefully by the time they realized the ship would be gone and the party secure inside the building, the plan seemed save and reliable, although Ksena was a little vague on breaking the mind control, the general didn’t think she had an idea on what to do, but it was her problem to deal with.
