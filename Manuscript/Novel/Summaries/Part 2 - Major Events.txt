Major Events - Part 2

- Ksena and Alcuin move from immediate survival to evidence-driven resistance groundwork.
- Burned settlements and field testimony confirm regime coercion against villages, validating earlier compliance fear.
- Temple and memoir evidence reframes official history as curated retreat, selective memory, and control doctrine.
- Industrial-belt investigations reveal mixed-culture engineering heritage and rapid infrastructure decay from centralized neglect.
- Decay is shown as managed dependency: command retains manuals, certifications, and parts allocation while blaming outer districts for failures.
- City-facing political encounters expose council theater and increasing signs that one internal authority is steering outcomes.
- Human contact broadens tactical options and intelligence but does not replace the core internal regime conflict.
- Kalani remains a recurring high-threat enforcer while early cracks in her certainty are seeded.
- Part 2 ends with stronger coalition alignment and clearer intent to challenge both control infrastructure and knowledge monopoly.
