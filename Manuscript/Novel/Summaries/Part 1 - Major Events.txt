Major Events - Part 1

- Ksena's elite household is politically powerful but emotionally aloof; older sisters have already ascended, leaving her isolated.
- City order is strict but unevenly enforced, and nepotism gives Ksena just enough freedom to move beneath full scrutiny.
- Pre-ritual contact with outside villages exists under controlled corridors, reinforcing that the regime fears outside entry most.
- Ksena's ritual fails in a way the system cannot neatly absorb, triggering immediate containment language.
- Tribunal framing treats Ksena as strategic risk while preserving public optics through "mercy doctrine."
- Her father quietly steers outcomes behind council procedure and positions exile to surface resistance links.
- Village compliance is coerced by credible threat of destruction; assigning Alcuin is survival politics, not willing cooperation.
- Part 1 closes with forced departure, relational fracture, and a clear shift from ceremony-dystopia into coercive survival.
