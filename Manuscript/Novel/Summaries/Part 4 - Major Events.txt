Major Events - Part 4

- Kalani's final arc slows down: redemption remains possible until late, then her own high-risk choices make survival impossible.
- Ksena witnesses Kalani's death directly, with emotional fallout given space before the final command confrontation.
- The father is confirmed as the true regime center using council structure as cover and control instrument.
- Final chamber conflict ends with collapse of command lattice and death of the father, breaking systemic compulsion.
- Post-collapse behavior is uneven: some fighters stand down immediately, others panic, and local deconfliction is required.
- Transition authority forms under pressure but remains provisional, contested, and visibly fragile.
- Book 1 closes on hard-won stabilization and family rescue, while broader long-horizon political threads are deferred to Book 2.
