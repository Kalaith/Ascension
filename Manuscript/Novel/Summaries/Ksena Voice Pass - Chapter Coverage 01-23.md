# Ksena Voice Pass - Chapter Coverage (01-23)

Guide used: `Manuscript/Novel/Summaries/Writers Voice Guide.txt`

Pass target:
- Keep close-third emotional anchoring.
- Strengthen Ksena-specific voice (curious, determined, emotionally open, increasingly strategic).
- Ensure chapter exits land on decision, risk, or emotional consequence.

## Part 1
- 01 - City of Flame.txt: Kept. Already strong Ksena lens, control-vs-self tension, and personal hook.
- 02 - Tribe and Alcuin.txt: Kept. Strong sensory contrast and relationship-driven Ksena voice.
- 03 - Family and Fault Lines.txt: Kept. Clear internal conflict and family-pressure framing.
- 04 - Ritual Failure and Sentence.txt: Kept. Strong emotional clarity and escalating stakes.
- 05 - Banishment Road.txt: Kept. Immediate survival voice and practical emotional beats.
- 06 - Touching the Outside World.txt: Kept. Good logistics-first narration with Ksena emotional cost.
- 07 - Hunting Party.txt: Kept. Tactical and relational tone aligned.
- 08 - Hidden Temple.txt: Kept. Discovery voice + consequence hook aligned.
- 09 - Meeting Estele.txt: Kept. Dialogue-led progression and forward hook aligned.

## Part 2
- 09A - Recovered Memoir - Invaders.txt: Kept. Lore is conflict-checked through Ksena/Alcuin rather than dumped.
- 10 - Conquest to Lies.txt: Kept. Strong emotional shock plus strategic pivot.
- 11 - Followed to Rest.txt: Kept. Alcuin-centered chapter still supports Ksena arc continuity.
- 12 - Ancient One to Beginning.txt: Kept. Ksena emotional/strategic transition is clear.
- 13 - Ancient Enemy to Birthplace.txt: Kept. Investigative voice and choice-based ending aligned.
- 14 - City to Homecoming.txt: Kept. Multi-thread chapter remains coherent with Ksena mission voice.
- 15 - General to Capture.txt: Kept. External POV chapter still resolves to Ksena-facing stakes.
- 16 - Ship Visit to Blushing.txt: Updated. Ending moved from observer/Kirk note to explicit Ksena emotional-strategic close.

## Part 3
- 17 - Meeting to Grandmother.txt: Kept. Strong pressure-dialogue and personal stakes.
- 18 - Revelation to Training.txt: Kept. Good balance of lore, emotion, and tactical discipline.
- 19 - Transformation to Change.txt: Kept. Maintains active, consequence-aware progression.
- 20 - Ascension to General.txt: Updated. Added final Ksena hook after operation launch to keep chapter anchored in her resolve/cost.
- 21 - Night Before to Arrival.txt: Updated. Removed detached antagonist-command exposition at close; anchored shift back to Ksena perception.

## Part 4
- 22 - Fall of the Crystal Regime.txt: Kept. Multi-perspective war framing retained, with Ksena emotional center in decisive beats.
- 23 - Rebuild and Future.txt: Kept. Ksena leadership voice and accountability tone aligned.

## Net Effect
- Ksena now closes critical transition chapters in a more personal, choice-driven voice.
- Detached report-style endings were reduced where they diluted emotional continuity.
- Chapter momentum remains tactical, but with clearer Ksena identity at emotional inflection points.
