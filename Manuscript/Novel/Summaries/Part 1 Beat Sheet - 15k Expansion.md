Beats:
1. Dawn bell routine introduces city order and performance culture; Ksena feels watched and ignored at the same time.

## Chapter 02 - Tribe and Alcuin (Target 1,550)

## Chapter 03 - Family and Fault Lines (Target 1,550)
Purpose: Increase family tension before ritual; show control mechanisms and silent betrayals.

Beats:
1. Family identity setup: power household, low intimacy, role-based interactions.

## Continuity Control Checklist for Drafting
1. Track injuries and recovery timing (especially Alcuin leg/arm and fatigue carryover).
2. Track supplies at every chapter end (water, protein, bandages, heat fuel).
3. Keep father's strategic shadow present through consequences, not exposition.
4. Keep Kalani as emotional pressure, not constant on-page combatant.
5. Ensure each chapter ends with a concrete next objective.
6. Maintain Ksena voice: emotionally open + increasingly strategic.

## Drafting Sequence
1. Expand chapters 1-5 to target counts.
2. Build full heavy-wilderness arcs in 6-8.
3. Draft new Chapter 9 from scratch.
4. Expand and renumber Meeting Estele as Chapter 10.
5. Run Part 1 word-count and chapter-floor check.
6. Run continuity pass before Part 2 handoff.
