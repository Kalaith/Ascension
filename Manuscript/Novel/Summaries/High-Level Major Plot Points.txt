High-Level Major Plot Points

1. Ksena's ascension fails in an unprecedented way, making her an anomaly and exposing cracks in the ruling order.
2. The true cause of that failure traces back to an external/native ritual influence, but this remains unknown to Ksena and others until much later.
3. City leadership marks Ksena as a threat and exiles her, publicly for stability but fundamentally because she is not under their control.
4. Ksena and Alcuin, already connected before exile, are forced into a survival alliance that deepens under pressure.
5. Ancient site discoveries indicate official history around ascension, lineage, and governance has been deliberately distorted.
6. Evidence accumulates that the ascension system is used as coercive mind control, producing constrained/partial ascension rather than true liberation.
7. Kalani's escalating violence demonstrates the regime's willingness to destroy whole communities to preserve power.
8. Human first contact expands the conflict from local factional struggle to broader strategic and planetary stakes.
9. Ksena's network shifts from reactive survival to organized resistance with cross-group allies.
10. Grandmother's return reframes the conflict as systemic domination, not only family conflict.
11. The crystal/barrier mechanism is confirmed as the central control and brainwashing infrastructure sustaining stratification.
12. Training, recruitment, and new ascensions erode the regime's monopoly on force and knowledge.
13. Resistance strategy evolves from evasion to deliberate operations targeting control infrastructure.
14. Endgame conflict collapses old command hierarchy into direct leadership confrontation.
15. Ksena defeats her father, ending the core of unilateral authoritarian control.
16. Post-conflict focus shifts from survival warfare to governance, accountability, and institutional redesign.
17. Rebuild establishes shared authority and cross-community systems, while future-facing chapters center long-term legacy and generational transition.
