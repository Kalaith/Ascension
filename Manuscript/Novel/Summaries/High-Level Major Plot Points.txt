High-Level Major Plot Points

1. Ksena grows up in an elite but emotionally distant family where older sisters ascended before her, leaving her isolated and underestimated.
2. The regime controls ascended citizens through ritual-conditioning infrastructure and prioritizes blocking outside entry over policing every insider movement.
3. Nepotism reduces scrutiny around Ksena, creating exploitable blind spots that later become plot-critical.
4. Ksena's ascension fails in an unprecedented way, exposing a control-system mismatch rather than simple personal weakness.
5. Her father uses the council as a public facade and redirects policy around her case, treating her as a low-threat asset to map resistance contacts.
6. Exile is imposed under coercive doctrine and enforced through village intimidation, including credible burn-order threats for non-compliance.
7. Ksena and Alcuin are forced into survival partnership; their bond develops inside real political and physical danger.
8. Ancient records and site evidence reveal deliberate historical erasure and the conversion of communal ascension into centralized rule.
9. Ksena's network grows from flight to organized resistance, while her sister serves as recurring personal antagonist under regime logic.
10. Human contact expands stakes but remains subordinate to the core internal conflict of control versus autonomy.
11. Midgame operations target crystal and relay systems to fracture conditioning capacity without mass civilian collapse.
12. Kalani's arc includes explicit off-ramps for surrender, but her own escalation choices repeatedly close those exits.
13. During the final campaign, Ksena witnesses Kalani's death as the direct consequence of Kalani's overreach after redemption is still possible.
14. Final confrontation reveals father as the true command authority; council legitimacy collapses with him.
15. Once command conditioning breaks, combat behavior shifts from regime cohesion to confusion, grief, and local ceasefires.
16. Immediate aftermath is unstable and contested; rebuilding is shown as hard coordination work, not instant policy success.
17. Book 1 closes on regime collapse and family rescue, with larger future governance and generational threads deferred to Book 2.
