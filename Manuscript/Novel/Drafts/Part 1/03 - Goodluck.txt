everywhere Ksena went today, she was wished for good luck; the city had little children in it, beside herself there was 2 others going through the ritual today, the ritual was held one per year for everyone that had come of age since the last ritual, this year was special in that 3 attendees, there was no ritual last year, no one was coming of age, the year beforehand her sister was the only one to do the ritual, the ritual was for both males and females, although there was only a small group of male ascendant, females where born more often and the population was female dominated, however the council of elders was predominantly male, it also meant things like marriage was not common, her parents being married was a rare exception, her mother served in the army that guarded the village, her father was one elder, the elders made all the rules and decisions, if Ksena was to have children in the future the elders would be the one to say so and they would also choose the father, Ksena would love a child, maybe a girl or two, but this wasn’t a decision coming up soon, she would first have to prove herself in the army, only the strongest where given permission to have children.
Since the other ritual attendees this year was around the same age as Ksena, she had grown up and played with them, only her involvement with the tribe outside stopped them from being a close as friends as she would have liked, especially since after her sister become ascendant and spent less time with her and none visiting the tribe, she had defiantly changed during the ritual; she was more aloof than before and very fixated on being the best among the ascendant. Ksena had asked if she wanted children. The look her sister gave her clarified that was a no.
The two other girls would visit around the city as we'll, they stuck together more, but neither had a sister like Ksena, which might have been why there was some distance between them, but Ksena was happy to be with her thoughts, and once they all became ascended, those walls would lessen they would be like sisters, Ksena wondered if her own relationship with her sister would be renewed when they could both do ascended activities together
By late morning the city was louder than usual, but it was not a joyful noise. It was preparation noise. Doors opening and closing. Orders repeated. Boots turning on stone. Even children who we're normally ignored we're directed to stay clear of ritual routes.

Ksena moved through all of it like someone watching her own life from a distance.

Everywhere she walked, people offered the same line.

"Good luck, candidate."

She answered each one with a smile that grew harder to hold.

Good luck did not sound like a blessing anymore. It sounded like a warning.

At the central cistern she met one of the older instructors, a woman who had corrected Ksena's stance since she was eight.

"Hands steady," the instructor said, tapping Ksena's wrist. "Whatever happens tomorrow, keep your hands steady."

"Is that all it takes?"

"No," the woman replied. "But it's all you control at the start."

Near the cloth market, two young guards she recognized from tower duty approached and bowed politely.

"Candidate Ksena," one said. "Your family sends congratulations."

"My family?"

"Your line," he clarified. "Not household family."

There it was again. Formal language replacing real words.

She thanked them anyway and kept walking.

She passed the district where younger children practiced basic flame discipline under supervision. They stood in neat rows, trying to keep tiny sparks hovering above their palms for ten breaths without wavering.

One little girl looked up and waved at Ksena with sudden excitement.

"Are you doing it tomorrow?"

"Yes."

"Can I watch?"

"From the balcony, maybe."

The girl grinned. "I want blue flames like my aunt."

"Then practice your breathing," Ksena said.

The girl's instructor immediately barked, "Eyes forward."

The smile vanished. The row reset.

Ksena continued on, uneasy.

At midday she visited the archive corridor where ritual records we're kept. Access was restricted, but she knew one archivist who tolerated her curiosity.

"Please," she said at the counter, "just the public entries for this year and last."

The archivist eyed her, then slid out the permitted tablets.

She scanned them quickly. Candidate lists. Assignment confirmations. Oath completions. Everything neat and ceremonial, no mention of fear, no mention of children shaking before touching the crystal.

"Do we keep private notes?" she asked.

"All records are private to someone," the archivist said dryly.

"I mean real notes. Complications."

The archivist lowered his voice. "Why ask questions on ritual eve?"

"Because everyone keeps speaking like the outcome is guaranteed."

"In this city," he said, "certainty is a public service."

He took the tablets back before she could ask more.

By afternoon the other two candidates found her near the sun court and asked if she wanted to walk the procession route one last time. She agreed.

They traced the exact path from holding chamber to crystal dais while a logistics official checked spacing and pace.

"Six steps, pause, bow, approach," he recited. "Do not speak unless prompted."

The first candidate whispered, "My knees are shaking."

"Mine too," the second whispered back.

Ksena glanced at them and felt an unexpected wave of affection. They we're all pretending to be brave because they thought everyone else was.

"After this," she said, "we should steal sweet rolls from the north kitchen."

Both girls stared at her in horror.

Then one snorted and clapped a hand over her mouth.

"You are impossible," she hissed.

"Maybe," Ksena said.

"Maybe that's useful," the other admitted.

As evening approached, she slipped through the side walk that led closest to the barrier's inner face. The shimmer threw gold light across the stones. She pressed her palm against the invisible curve and felt the familiar warmth that had always made her think of home.

Tomorrow, that same barrier might feel different.

The thought came from nowhere and would not leave.

She found Alcuin where they usually met, between the old fig roots and the maintenance wall where patrol sight lines overlapped just enough to create short blind intervals.

He looked anxious before she even reached him.

"You took too long," he said.

"So did you."

"I was avoiding a patrol pair that now thinks I'm suspiciously interested in tree bark."

She laughed despite herself.

He held out a wrapped packet. "Dried fruit. For after tomorrow."

"You planned for after?"

"Someone should."

They sat on the roots and shared the packet in silence for a minute.

"Everyone keeps saying good luck," she said finally.

"Do you want me to say it too?"

"No."

"Good. I hate that phrase."

"Why?"

"Because it means people are admitting they can't help you."

She looked at him sharply.

"Then what should you say?"

He thought for a moment. "Come back."

Her throat tightened unexpectedly.

"Come back," she repeated.

"Yeah." He kicked at a root. "I know your world changes tomorrow. I just... don't want it to erase you."

She leaned her shoulder against his for one brief, dangerous moment.

"I'll try," she said.

On her way home, she found Kalani in the courtyard drilling against two spar partners at once. Flame trails snapped through the air in clean arcs, precise and merciless.

Ksena waited until the drill ended.

"You look good," she offered.

Kalani wiped sweat from her brow. "You look tired."

"I am."

"Sleep."

"Helpful advice."

Kalani almost smiled, then the expression vanished.

"Tomorrow," she said, lowering her voice, "do not fight the pull."

Ksena frowned. "Fight what pull?"

"Just don't."

Before Ksena could ask more, a drill captain called Kalani back into formation.

That warning sat in Ksena's chest all night.

Later, in her room, she laid out the items she planned to carry into ritual morning. Ceremonial cloth. Wrist ties. Small comb. The wrapped dried fruit from Alcuin hidden beneath the cloth where no one would see.

She wrote a note she did not intend to send, because writing felt safer than speaking.

If I change tomorrow, please remind me who I was before.

She folded the note and tucked it under the carved fox.

When final bell rang, she blew out her room light and lay in darkness listening to her own pulse.

Good luck had followed her all day like a shadow.

In the dark she chose her own phrase instead, whispering it once to the ceiling.

Come back.

Before sleep, Ksena tied Alcuin's carved token into the inner seam of her ritual sleeve so no attendant could remove it without noticing. It was a tiny rebellion, but it made her feel less alone.

She slept with that token in her hand and woke with her fingers still wrapped around it.

That mattered more than luck.

She clung to that thought.

When dawn finally came, she stepped toward it with fear in her chest and purpose in her hands.
