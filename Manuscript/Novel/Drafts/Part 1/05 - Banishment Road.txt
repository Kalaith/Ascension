They made camp in a shallow ridge cut after dark because neither of them could walk straight anymore.

Alcuin built fire in silence, movements clipped and efficient.

Ksena sat with her back against stone and watched sparks climb into night.

No bells marked time out here.

No walls reflected heat.

No one told them where to stand.

It should have felt like freedom.

It felt like falling.

Alcuin set a strip of cooked meat on a flat stone near her boots.

"Eat," he said.

"Not hungry."

"Eat anyway."

She did.

They finished in silence. It wasn't just exhaustion. It was the kind of bone-deep fatigue that made her hands shake when she lifted the water flask. Her boots felt like lead weights. The cold from the stone was already seeping through her trousers, numbing her legs.

After a long stretch, Alcuin spoke without looking at her.

"What did they say in tribunal?"

"Resistance. Contamination. Mercy doctrine."

He gave a short bitter laugh.

"Mercy."

Ksena pulled knees closer.

"I didn't ask for any of this."

"I know."

"You sound like you don't."

He poked fire harder than needed.

"I sound like someone who lost his village position because he trusted city terms for one day."

The words landed hard because they were partly true.

"I'm sorry," Ksena said.

Alcuin dragged both hands over his face.

"I know you are. Doesn't fix route planning."

He tossed her a folded map strip.

"We have maybe four days of food if we ration hard. Nearest reliable water after this ridge is two half-days west if markers still hold."

She forced focus.

"After that?"

"After that we improvise and try not to die."

A distant howl rolled over stone.

Ksena stiffened.

"Wolves?"

"Maybe. Maybe not. Stay near fire anyway."

He took first watch. She slept in fragments.

By dawn the fire was embers and both were colder than they admitted.

They moved west over broken ground beneath a sky too clear for mercy. Midday brought no shade and little water. Conversation narrowed to practical calls.

"Step left."

"Loose scree."

"Short break, then move."

Near second ridge line they found old track marks and a carved post half-buried in dust.

Alcuin brushed it clean.

"Trade route marker," he said. "Old. Still points toward water."

By late afternoon they reached marker spring and filled both flasks. Ksena splashed water over her face until she could think again.

"What now?" she asked.

Alcuin looked west where plains broke into rougher country.

"Now we stop pretending we'll be let back in after a week," he said. "We plan for long term."

He counted on fingers.

"Food route. Shelter route. People we can trust, if any. Places your father's network can't monitor directly."

Ksena touched the carved bird hidden in her sleeve.

"I saw locations in the ritual images," she said. "Old stations, maybe temple-linked."

Alcuin studied her.

"You sure?"

"No. But it felt real."

He thought for several beats.

"Then we test one location. If it's nothing, we lose time. If it's real, we gain options."

For the first time since exile, a decision felt like theirs.

They moved again before sunset and made second camp in a shallow cave mouth screened by scrub.

After dark, howls came closer.

Not one.

A pack.

Alcuin banked fire low and handed Ksena a spear she barely knew how to hold.

"If they rush, stay behind me and do not run."

She nodded, throat dry.

The wolves circled but did not commit. Eyes flashed at edge of firelight, vanished, reappeared farther left.

Hours passed like that.

At first light the pack was gone.

Ksena had not slept.

Neither had Alcuin.

They broke camp slower than they liked. Fatigue sat behind both eyes. Alcuin assigned micro-rest intervals every forty minutes whether they wanted them or not.

By midday clouds rolled in from north and turned open plain into wind corridor. Dust cut visibility. Temperature dropped fast.

They found shelter in a half-collapsed waystation. Alcuin braced doorway with broken timber and set a smoke-thin fire in center pit.

Ksena held hands over heat and felt useless.

"I slowed us down again," she said.

Alcuin kept working.

"You kept moving. That's what matters today."

She hated that reassurance made her want to cry.

Instead she pulled supplies for inventory.

"We have three and a half days food if we cut portions," she said. "One medical roll, two needles, one spare cord, no spare boots."

"No spare boots?"

"You dropped the bundle when we ran the second ridge."

"Good. Love that for us."

She snorted despite herself.

He looked up, surprised.

"There. Keep that."

"What?"

"That sound. Means you aren't broken yet."

Evening brought rain, then hard wind, then silence.

They tried to sleep and failed.

On second watch, Ksena whispered into dark.

"Did you ever think you'd leave your village like this?"

"No," Alcuin said. "I thought if I left, it would be for trade season, maybe one winter route."

"I thought I'd fail at something small," she said. "Not... this."

"You didn't fail small or large," he said. "You failed their design. That's different."

In morning they climbed out of waystation and found fresh tracks near the south slope.

Not wolf.

Boots.

Two people, moving east to west, trying to erase sign and failing.

Alcuin crouched, fingers near print.

"Not hunters," he said.

"Patrol?"

"Maybe. Or scouts from someone who doesn't want city seeing them."

They altered route immediately, cutting through scrub channels where sign was harder to read.

By midafternoon, Alcuin slipped on shale and sliced palm on exposed rock. Ksena cleaned the cut, wrapped it, and tightened the tie with steadier hands than she had expected.

"You've done this before," Alcuin said.

"Not outside a clinic room," she answered. "But blood looks the same in every district."

He flexed hand, nodded once, and they kept moving.

Late in day they reached low rise marked by weathered stone stack. One face of the top rock had a carved symbol half-eroded by wind.

Ksena ran fingers over it and felt an electric prickle at base of her wrist.

"This is one of the symbols from the image sequence," she said.

Alcuin scanned horizon.

"Then we decide now."

Safe route west toward known water.

Risk route north toward unknown ruin line.

The wind picked up. Light dropped.

Ksena looked from symbol to sky and knew whichever choice they made would define what exile became.

Punishment.

Or investigation.

"North," she said.

Alcuin did not argue.

"Then north with discipline," he said. "No hero nonsense."

They camped without fire that night, cold and alert, with one watch each and the spear between them.

Before dawn, Ksena woke to distant thunder she could not tell from memory of engines. She touched the carved bird through sleeve cloth and forced breathing back to steady.

Exile had begun as sentence.

Now it was becoming evidence.

Whatever the city feared in her ritual was already moving through the outside world.

And she was walking toward it with one hunter, one damaged map, and no home to return to.

Late on the next rise, they found their first deliberate decoy marker: three stones stacked in standard trade code, but set two hand-widths too far left from actual path.

"Someone wanted travelers walking into washout," Alcuin said.

Ksena crouched beside stack.

"Could be old."

"Could. But the top stone still has clean scrape edge. Recent."

They skirted the washout and discovered collapsed ground exactly where false marker directed.

A fall there would have broken legs, maybe necks.

Ksena stared into pit.

"This isn't just hostile weather anymore."

"No," Alcuin said. "Now it's hostile people using weather."

They moved until dusk and stopped near broken monolith with half-erased glyph ring.

While Alcuin set thorn alarms, Ksena opened field slate. She started to write a list of rules, then stopped. Ink didn't make them real. Only memory did.

*Never trust a single marker.* That was the first lesson.

*Verify path with terrain, not symbols alone.* That was the second.

*Assume observed unless proven otherwise.*

*Decide routes with fatigue in mind, not pride.*

Alcuin watched her stare at the blank slate.

"Add one more," he said.

"What?"

"If one of us says stop, we stop. No debate during immediate threat."

Ksena nodded. She didn't write that one down either. She just memorized the weight of it.

They sealed the agreement by pressing their thumbs into the wet charcoal edge of the slate frame.

Not ritual.

Contract.

That night, with no wolves and no patrol lights, they still slept lightly.

Outside had taught them quickly.

Survival was less about courage than consistency.

Courage got you moving.

Consistency kept you alive long enough for courage to matter.

Near sunrise she looked at Alcuin and realized something had changed.

He was no longer just the person she trusted from the village.

He was now the person she trusted with decisions that could kill them both.

That trust had weight.

When first wind hit the ridge, Ksena tightened her grip on the spear and adjusted pace to match Alcuin's limp without comment.

Coordination before comfort.

That rule would keep repeating.

They kept walking.

Forward was the only direction left with room for choice.

The horizon did not soften.

Neither did they.
