They made camp in a shallow ridge cut after dark because neither of them could walk straight anymore.

Alcuin built fire in silence, movements clipped and efficient.

Ksena sat with her back to a stone outcrop and watched sparks climb into the night.

No bells marked time out here.

No walls reflected heat.

No one told them where to stand.

It should have felt like freedom.

It felt like falling.

Alcuin set a strip of cooked meat on a flat stone near her boots.

"Eat," he said.

"Not hungry."

"Eat anyway."

She did.

They finished in silence that was half exhaustion and half anger too new to name.

After a long time, Alcuin spoke without looking at her.

"What did they say to you in tribunal?"

"Resistance. Contamination. Mercy doctrine."

He gave a short, bitter laugh.

"Mercy."

Ksena pulled her knees closer.

"I didn't ask for any of this."

"I know."

"You sound like you don't."

He poked the fire harder than needed.

"I sound like someone who lost his village because he trusted city rules for one day."

The words landed hard because they were partly true.

Ksena looked into flame until her eyes blurred.

"I'm sorry," she said.

Alcuin rubbed both hands over his face and exhaled.

"I know you are. Doesn't fix route planning."

He tossed her a folded map strip.

"We have maybe four days of food if we ration hard. Nearest safe water after this ridge is two half-days west if markers are still good."

She forced herself to focus.

"And after that?"

"After that we improvise and try not to die."

Somewhere beyond camp perimeter, a distant howl rolled across stone.

Ksena stiffened.

"Wolves?"

"Maybe. Maybe not. Stay close to fire anyway."

He stood, checked weapon straps, and scanned the dark.

"I'm taking first watch. You sleep."

"I can't."

"You can collapse on your feet tomorrow or you can sleep now. Pick one."

She hated that he was right.

By dawn, the fire was embers and both of them were colder than they admitted.

They moved west over broken ground under a sky too clear for mercy.

Midday brought no shade and little water. Conversation narrowed to practical calls.

"Step left."

"Loose scree ahead."

"Short break, then move."

Near second ridge line they found old track marks and one carved post half-buried in dust.

Alcuin brushed it clean.

"Trade route marker," he said. "Old. Still points toward water."

By late afternoon they reached the marker spring and filled both flasks.

Ksena knelt and splashed water over her face until she could think again.

"What now?" she asked.

Alcuin looked west where plains fell into rougher country.

"Now we stop pretending we'll be let back in after a week," he said. "We plan for long term."

He counted on fingers.

"Food route. Shelter route. People we can trust, if any. Places your council can't monitor directly."

Ksena touched the carved bird hidden in her sleeve.

"There are old temple maps in the ritual images," she said. "I saw locations the city never taught us."

Alcuin turned toward her.

"You sure?"

"No. But it felt real."

He thought for several seconds.

"Then we test one location," he said. "If it's nothing, we lose a day. If it's real, we gain options."

For the first time since exile, a decision felt like theirs.

They moved again before sunset and made second camp in a shallow cave mouth screened by scrub.

After dark, howls came closer.

Not one.

A pack.

Alcuin banked the fire low and handed Ksena a spear she barely knew how to hold.

"If they rush, stay behind me and do not run," he said.

She nodded, throat dry.

The wolves circled but did not commit. Eyes flashed at edge of firelight, then vanished, then reappeared farther left.

Hours passed like that.

At first light, the pack was gone.

Ksena had not slept.

Neither had Alcuin.

As they broke camp, he looked at the open plain and said what both already knew.

"This is only the start."

Ksena adjusted her pack, felt the carved bird press against her wrist, and nodded.

The world outside had touched them now.

It was not beautiful.

It was real.
