Ksena mother felt off, her daughter had failed and after her other daughter had been so successful, she thought she was blessed with two gifted children, but everything was falling apart, Kalani was defiantly gifted, but something with the power had changed her, she wasn't the same girl as before the ritual, everyone changed a little, but she went from sweet to terrifying and so quickly, and now her other daughter was exiled from the village after failing her ritual, it still made little sense, something was defiantly off, her only relief was the fact that her daughter was actually free, she had always been too advantage to the savages, she had tried to warn her away but Ksena just kept visiting, and now she could never go home, she could never embrace her child again, and with the news that she was scouting out ancient ritual sites these had been forbidden to all savages, they didn't even try to argue it with them, if a savage went to one of the ancient temples, their tribe was usually erased from existence
She hated those missions where they would remove all life from a tribe; she didn't hate the savages she respected they had a life and forced to take part in their desecration always left a bad taste in her mouth, but she couldn't disobey, none of them could, and she just hoped her daughter wouldn't be put a situation where she was forced to fight her, because she already knew she would lose, hanging her hands in her head she cried herself to sleep
She did not cry in front of the council.

That was the first rule she had learned after ascension. Never give the ring your grief. Grief became leverage in that room. Tears became admission. Questions became disloyalty.

So when the First Elder informed her that Ksena had "failed alignment" and would be "reassigned under mercy doctrine," she stood straight, flame controlled, and answered exactly as expected.

"I understand."

Only after she left did her knees begin to shake.

She crossed three courtyards before anyone could stop her and reached her private chamber with her breath coming hard, like she had run across open plains again as a child. The door sealed behind her. The silence hit like impact.

She sat on the floor, not the chair, because she did not trust her body to stay upright if she pretended to be dignified.

Ksena failed.

No. Not failed.

Resisted.

The ritual master had not said the word aloud, but she had watched his mouth hesitate around it.

Resisted.

Her first daughter, Kalani, had not resisted. Kalani had stepped into fire and stepped out sharper, colder, obedient with a smile that no longer reached her eyes. At first she told herself that was maturity. Then she told herself it was duty. Then she stopped naming it at all.

Ksena had always been different. Softer and louder at once. Curious where she should have been cautious. Kind when kindness made life inconvenient. She asked why more than any child in the district, and every time her mother told her to stop, Ksena tilted her head and asked anyway.

That stubbornness used to make her proud.

Now it had nearly killed her.

A knock came at her door.

"Enter," she said, voice steady by force.

Kalani walked in, flames coiling around her wrists in controlled ribbons. Perfect posture. Perfect breathing. Perfect soldier.

"You heard," her mother said.

"Yes."

"And?"

Kalani's expression barely shifted. "Council has spoken."

"That is not what I asked."

A flicker crossed Kalani's face, fast as lightning. "I asked for access to Ksena. Denied."

Her mother stared at her. That was not nothing.

"You asked twice?"

"Three times."

"Why?"

Kalani looked toward the shuttered window instead of answering immediately. "Because she is my sister."

The words sounded practiced, but there was heat under them.

"Do you believe she is a danger?" her mother asked quietly.

"I believe the council believes she is unpredictable."

"That is not an answer."

Kalani's jaw tightened. "Unpredictable is danger in this city."

There it was. The lesson burned into her by ritual and rank.

"Do you remember," her mother said, "the day before your own ascension? You stole honey cakes and hid in the irrigation tunnels because you we're afraid you would throw up in front of everyone."

For the first time, Kalani blinked in genuine surprise.

"That was a long time ago."

"Two years."

"It feels longer."

"I know."

Silence stretched between them. They used to fill silence with jokes, complaints, plans for evening meals. Now silence felt like patrol duty.

"They are sending her out," Kalani said at last.

"I know."

"With one escort from the village."

"I know."

"If she survives long enough, they will use her as bait for anyone else asking questions."

The words came out flat, tactical, and that terrified her mother more than tears would have.

"Do you hear yourself?" she asked.

Kalani met her eyes then, and there was something raw there. "Do you think I don't?"

Her mother stood and crossed the room in two steps, taking Kalani by both shoulders. For a heartbeat Kalani went rigid, then allowed the contact.

"Listen to me," she whispered. "Whatever they put in your head, whatever they tell you about duty, Ksena is not your enemy."

Kalani did not pull away. "I know."

"Do you?"

"I know," Kalani repeated, this time through clenched teeth. "But knowing and acting are not the same under their eyes."

That answer was too honest. Too dangerous.

Her mother let go and stepped back.

"Then we survive long enough to make them the same," she said.

Kalani looked at her for a long moment. "You are saying treason in a room that might be listening."

"Then let it listen."

The door knocked again, harder this time.

Both women turned.

A council aide stood outside with a sealed tablet and official tone.

"By instruction of the First Elder: you will prepare Candidate Ksena's travel packet with standard exile provisions. No private communication beyond practical guidance. Candidate departs at dawn with tribal escort."

He paused just long enough to make the warning clear.

"Compliance will be observed."

He left before either woman could answer.

Kalani exhaled. "Observed."

Her mother nodded once. "Then we give them something to observe."

They spent the next hour assembling provisions under the gaze of two guards stationed near the corridor arch. Dried ration blocks. Wrapped bandage cloth. Water purifier stones. Needle and thread. Flint striker. Salt packets. The city called it mercy. She called it guilt in a basket.

When the bundle was complete, she carried it herself to the temporary holding room where Ksena waited.

The guards at the door crossed spears.

"Five minutes," one said.

"I raised her," the mother replied.

"Five minutes," he repeated.

Inside, Ksena sat on a narrow bench with her hands clasped so tightly her knuckles we're pale. She looked up when the door opened, and for a moment she was just a child again waiting to be told whether she was in trouble.

"Mother."

The word nearly broke her.

She set the bundle down and knelt so they were at eye level.

"You are leaving at dawn."

"I know."

"You will not argue with the village elder. You will not stop in the low ravines after dark. You will avoid ridge lines in open weather. If you hear wingbeats, shelter first and look second."

Ksena's eyes filled, but she nodded through each instruction.

"I failed," she whispered. "I tried not to. I don't even know what I did wrong."

Her mother took her face in both hands.

"You did not fail," she said. "You survived a thing that was never honest with you."

Ksena searched her expression, confused and frightened. "What does that mean?"

She could feel the guards outside, the listening stone somewhere in the wall, the weight of every forbidden truth pressing at her teeth.

"It means this," she said carefully. "Trust what you felt in the circle. Even if everyone tells you it was wrong."

Ksena swallowed hard. "Will you come with me?"

The question tore through every defense she had.

"If I step outside without orders," she said, voice breaking despite herself, "they will call it desertion and they will send Kalani after me."

Ksena shut her eyes.

"I don't want her to have to choose," her mother added.

"She already did," Ksena said quietly. "She chose them."

"No," her mother said, firm now. "She is still fighting in ways you cannot see."

Ksena looked uncertain, but she listened.

Her mother pulled a small leather cord from her own wrist and tied it around Ksena's.

"This belonged to my mother," she said. "When you are cold, wrap it around your fingers. When you are afraid, remember your fear means your mind is still yours."

A knock at the door. "Time."

She ignored it for one heartbeat longer and leaned forward, pressing her forehead to Ksena's.

"You are not abandoned," she whispered. "You are being pushed into darkness. There is a difference."

Then she stood, because if she did not stand she would not leave.

At the door she looked back once.

Ksena sat straighter with the cord around her wrist and the bundle at her feet, trying very hard to look brave.

It looked exactly like pretending.

In the corridor, Kalani waited in shadow.

"Did you tell her?" Kalani asked.

"Not enough."

"You never can with walls listening."

They walked together toward the outer balcony overlooking the barrier fields. Below, patrol units moved in neat lines, flames bright against evening blue. Efficient. Loyal. Terrifying.

"Do you hate me?" Kalani asked suddenly.

The mother turned in surprise.

"For what?"

"For not stopping this."

She studied her daughter's face, the hard edges where softness used to live.

"I hate what they did to your choices," she said. "I do not hate you."

Kalani looked away quickly, as if that answer hurt more than accusation.

"At dawn," Kalani said, regaining control, "I am assigned barrier reinforcement on the east side. Deliberately."

"To keep you from the gate."

"Yes."

"Then I will watch from the west tower," her mother said. "If they deny me, I will stand where they can see me and deny me to my face."

Kalani gave the smallest nod.

Dawn came with thin cloud and cold wind.

From the west tower, the mother watched the exile procession form at the lower road: village escorts, one city observer, two guards, and between them Ksena with a pack too large for her shoulders and determination set like steel under fear.

Alcuin joined her at the boundary marker and did not look toward the tower.

Wise boy. If he looked up, they might follow his gaze.

The order was read aloud. Signatures exchanged. Witness marks stamped in wax.

Then Ksena crossed the line.

Her mother gripped the tower rail so hard the stone chipped under heated fingers.

Do not call out, she told herself.

Do not make this harder.

She watched until Ksena was a moving dot on the pale plain, until even that dot vanished in dust.

Only then did she allow herself to cry, silent and furious and brief.

When she left the tower, she found a junior officer waiting with a polite bow.

"The First Elder requests your presence for post-event debrief."

Of course he did.

She wiped her face with her sleeve and straightened.

"Tell him I am coming," she said.

The officer hesitated. "Now?"

"Now."

If they wanted obedience, they would get it.

If they wanted surrender, they would keep waiting.

As she crossed the upper bridge toward the council wing, she touched the empty place on her wrist where the leather cord had been and swallowed what she could not say aloud.

Tonight she would stand in formation and watch the city tighten its grip.
