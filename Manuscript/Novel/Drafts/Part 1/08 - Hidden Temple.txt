The door opened with a groan like old metal remembering how to move.

Cold air rolled out, carrying dust and something sharper, ozone maybe, maybe old power.

"Inside," Alcuin said.

They slipped through. The door sealed behind them just as claws scraped stone outside.

Wolves.

More than one.

The sound circled and faded, then returned, confused by the lack of scent trail.

Ksena leaned against the wall, chest heaving.

"I thought we'd die out there."

Alcuin listened another few seconds before nodding.

"Maybe still. Just slower."

He found a wall strip and hit it with his palm. Nothing.

Ksena ran fingers along carved seam near entry node the way she had seen attendants activate city locks.

Light flickered once, then spread in weak bands down the corridor.

The place was older than anything in her city and more complex than village ruins.

Not a tomb.

A station.

Three side chambers opened off the main hall.

The first held broken storage racks.

The second held cracked screens and dead consoles.

The third made both of them stop.

A central table projected a faded map when Ksena touched the edge ring.

Points of light marked locations across the plains and beyond.

Some symbols matched the flashes she had seen during ritual failure.

Others were new.

Alcuin leaned in.

"Can you read it?"

"Parts," Ksena said. "Old script."

She traced one symbol cluster near their current position, then another farther north.

"These are linked sites. Not random ruins."

Alcuin scanned the map, then the room.

"Any mention of people?"

Ksena touched another control and winced when a fragmentary image sequence pulsed to life.

Armored figures.

Fire in the sky.

Ascendants and tribal fighters in the same line.

Then smoke.

Then nothing.

The projection collapsed into static.

"Same images," she said quietly. "The ritual showed me this."

Alcuin rubbed his jaw.

"So either your ritual pulled old records or someone wanted you to see these places."

"Either way, we need to follow them."

He did not answer immediately.

Outside, a wolf hit the sealed door hard enough to rattle the frame.

"First we survive tonight," he said.

They searched the station for anything useful.

They found a half-working water recycler, two intact thermal wraps, and one lockbox with preserved ration bricks that tasted like chalk and old salt but kept them alive.

No weapons.

No clear logs.

Near second watch, corridor lights dimmed to emergency low.

Ksena sat with knees pulled in, map image burned into memory.

"If this connects to my failure," she said, "the elders knew more than they told us."

"They always do," Alcuin said.

"Why keep us ignorant?"

Alcuin stared at the sealed door.

"Because ignorant people are easier to rule."

At dawn, the wolf pack had moved on.

The door opened to gray light and wind-scoured ground.

Ksena copied the map by hand onto cloth strip while Alcuin checked tracks.

"We head north-east," she said. "There should be a trade outpost before next marker."

Alcuin adjusted his pack and nodded.

"If we find people there, we buy information and keep your hood up."

She managed a tired smile.

"You think I stand out?"

"Only if breathing counts."

They left the station with new route, thinner food stores, and one shared certainty:

The world outside the barrier was not empty.

It was layered with old systems someone had buried on purpose.

And now they were walking straight through those layers with no backup and no room for another mistake.
