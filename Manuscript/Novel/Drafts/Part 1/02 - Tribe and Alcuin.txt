Ksena crossed the barrier at dawn through the licensed contact corridor used for city-village trade and ritual preparation visits.

On paper it was controlled movement.

In practice it was selective control.

Two wardens watched the lane and pretended to study cargo ledgers while she passed. A normal candidate would have been logged twice, questioned once, and escorted back before midday.

Ksena got a nod and silence.

Nepotism disguised as trust.

The city side smelled of hot stone, oil, and ash-treated cloth. Outside smelled like wet dirt, wood smoke, fish brine, and animal hide.

She preferred the second one.

Wind hit her face the moment she cleared the corridor gate. With it came sound the city never allowed: children shouting near water troughs, a hammer striking wagon iron, two traders arguing about fish weight at full volume and then laughing halfway through the argument.

No bells.

No patrol cadence.

Just life.

Alcuin waited at the path marker, one shoulder against a fence post as if he had been there all night.

"You are late," he said.

"You always say that first."

"It keeps me from saying I was worried."

She smiled despite the pressure sitting in her chest.

"I was escorted to upper district twice yesterday," she lied.

Alcuin gave her a flat look.

"No, you weren't."

"How do you know?"

"Because if they had, you would have opened with anger instead of sarcasm."

He pushed off the post and led her into village lanes.

Alcuin moved like someone born to terrain. He checked track signs without seeming to look, nodded to elders with brief respect, and adjusted pace each time she drifted toward a conversation she was not supposed to have.

He was sixteen like her and already carried himself like someone with obligations he never requested.

The village children treated him like older brother and dangerous animal at once.

They treated Ksena like a rumor that sometimes became real.

At the central cook pit, a girl with ash on her cheeks offered Ksena a strip of dried fruit with both hands.

"For tomorrow," the girl said.

Ksena accepted it the same way.

"Thank you."

The girl's mother pulled her gently back before city watchers on the distant ridge could notice the exchange.

No one explained why.

Everyone understood.

The village paid the city in grain, cured meat, hide, and worked metal under the language of protection. No one used the word extortion in front of sentries.

They used it everywhere else.

Alcuin led her past tool sheds and smoke racks toward outer mat ring, where departure rites were held for hunters and travelers.

On the way, three elders sat near a split cedar table sorting route tokens by district mark. One of them, Elder Rethan, looked up as Ksena passed.

"Tomorrow, then," he said.

"Tomorrow," Ksena replied.

"If you return changed," he said, "remember we knew you before the city named what you were worth."

She stopped, unsure whether to thank him or apologize.

Alcuin answered for both of them.

"She hears you," he said.

At outer ring, he arranged three river stones and a strip of woven grass cord in a pattern absent from city ritual diagrams.

"What's this called?" Ksena asked.

"No translation in your city language," he said. "Closest meaning is ask for clear judgment when fear gets loud."

"Very flattering that you think I have judgment."

He looked up at her.

"Kneel."

She did.

He chanted in old dialect, voice rough at first, then steady. The words were half prayer, half reminder, each phrase naming something to keep and something to release.

Keep breath.

Release noise.

Keep name.

Release fear of witnesses.

When he finished, silence held between them.

"Anything?" he asked.

Ksena opened her eyes.

"Calmer," she said. "Maybe because someone finally talked to me like a person and not a candidate."

His mouth twitched toward a smile and stopped halfway.

"After tomorrow," he said, "if something feels wrong, don't ignore it because someone in flame cloth calls it protocol."

"You think I'll change like Kalani."

"I think no one comes out of that hall untouched."

The truth sat between them all afternoon.

They walked fence line where he had taught her tracks by depth and spacing. He pointed out rabbit trails, old boar sign, and a recent patrol cut where city scouts had walked deliberately wide to be seen.

"Show of force," Alcuin said.

"Or reminder," Ksena answered.

"Same thing if you're the one being reminded."

Near the irrigation ditch they found Maera, one of Alcuin's hunting peers, tightening a rope bridge anchor. She glanced from Alcuin to Ksena and back, expression unreadable.

"You brought city trouble again," Maera said.

"I brought a friend," Alcuin replied.

"Those are not always different things."

Ksena stepped forward before Alcuin could answer.

"I won't stay long," she said. "I just wanted to see this side before tomorrow."

Maera studied her for a moment, then nodded once.

"Then see it properly," she said. "Not from the path your wardens approve."

She walked them to the ridge above village, where old burn scars cut black lines through grass from last dry season's city strike response.

"Protection zone," Maera said, bitterness clear. "Their term, not ours."

Ksena stared at the scars and felt shame rise hot in her throat.

"I didn't know."

"You weren't meant to know," Maera said.

Alcuin intervened before the exchange could harden.

"We have to get back before second dusk bell."

On return route they stopped at Alcuin's home compound. His mother was mending winter cloaks by the doorway. She looked up, saw Ksena, and set the work aside.

"Eat before you go," she said.

Ksena tried to refuse. Alcuin's mother ignored the attempt and served both of them thick stew with root vegetables and smoked meat.

No ceremony.

No speeches.

Just food and the kind of care that made Ksena suddenly aware of how long it had been since anyone fed her without evaluating her.

Before they left, Alcuin disappeared into storage hut and returned with a wrapped wooden token.

"Keep this in your sleeve," he said, pressing it into her hand.

A carved bird, rough and uneven, one wing slightly lower than the other.

"So tomorrow isn't only theirs," he said.

She closed her fingers around it.

"Come with me to the barrier," she said.

He did.

At the threshold he stopped where he always had to stop.

"Come back whole," he said.

Ksena stepped into barrier light.

"I'll try."

On city side, air felt thinner again.

She did not look back until second corridor gate. Alcuin still stood by the boundary stone, smaller with distance than she wanted him to be.

At preparation check, attendants scanned her candidate band, recorded her hydration level, and sent her to sleep quarters with curfew instructions.

She hid the carved bird in ritual sleeve lining and stitched it into place with the needle she had bought the day before.

By last bell she sat alone on her bunk, fingers sore from stitching, and stared at the seam until she could no longer tell if she had hidden the token for luck, defiance, or memory.

Tomorrow she would stand before a crystal shaped by people who called this village primitive and this friendship dangerous.

Tonight she remembered how real she felt outside the walls.

It made what waited inside them harder to accept.

On her way back through the corridor gate, a junior warden stepped out of shadow and held up one hand.

"Candidate Ksena. Pause for notation."

Her pulse jumped. She kept her face calm.

"Of course."

He checked her band, entered a line on slate, then hesitated.

"Off record," he said quietly, eyes fixed on the screen instead of her, "outer patrol frequency doubled this week."

"Why tell me?"

"Because my sister married into a border village, and doubled patrols usually means someone in upper command is preparing to blame someone with fewer walls."

He handed slate back and stepped aside before she could ask more.

Inside city limits she walked slower than usual, replaying the sentence until it settled.

Not warning for ritual.

Warning for what came after.

At evening meal, her mother asked only one question.

"Did you complete your permitted contact route?"

"Yes."

"Any irregularities?"

Ksena could have said no and ended it.

Instead she said, "Patrols were heavier than last week."

Her mother's spoon paused midair, then resumed.

"Outer conditions change. Focus on tomorrow."

Kalani did not look up from her own bowl.

Ksena stopped asking.

That night she added one line to the inside cover of her field slate, where no attendant checked:

If they expand patrols before my ritual, the ritual is not the only event being planned.

At lights-out she checked the sleeve seam one last time and whispered three words she had learned from Alcuin's rite.

Keep name first.

Outside the walls those words meant courage.

Inside the walls they meant resistance.
