Ksena crossed the barrier at dawn through a maintenance cut she had used since she was twelve.

The city side smelled like hot stone and oil. The outside smelled like wet dirt and wood smoke and animal hide.

She preferred the second one.

Wind hit her face as soon as she stepped through, and with it came noise the city never allowed. Children shouting near water trough. Someone hammering a wagon pin back into place. Three people arguing openly over fish weight at morning trade fire.

No bells.

No patrol cadence.

Just life.

Alcuin was waiting at the path marker as if he had been standing there all night.

"You are late," he said.

"You always say that first," Ksena replied.

"It keeps me from saying I was worried."

She smiled despite the pressure in her chest.

Alcuin moved with hunter confidence through the village lanes, nodding to elders, checking tracks without seeming to look, adjusting pace whenever she drifted toward a conversation she was not supposed to be having.

He was sixteen like her and already carried himself like someone with obligations.

The village children treated him like older brother and dangerous animal at once.

They treated Ksena like a rumor who sometimes became real.

At the central cook pit, a girl with ash on her cheeks held out a strip of dried fruit to Ksena.

"For tomorrow," she said.

Ksena took it with both hands.

"Thank you."

The girl's mother pulled her gently back before city watchers on distant ridge could notice the exchange.

No one said why.

Everyone understood.

Alcuin led Ksena to outer mat ring near edge huts where old prayer circles were held for departures and hunts.

He knelt and arranged three river stones and a strip of woven grass cord in a pattern she had never seen in city ritual diagrams.

"What's this one called?" she asked.

"No idea in city language," he said. "In ours it means ask for clear judgment when fear gets loud."

"Very flattering that you think I have judgment."

He looked up at her.

"Kneel."

She did.

He chanted in old dialect, voice rough at first, then steady. The words were half prayer, half reminder.

When he finished, silence held the space between them.

"Anything?" he asked.

Ksena opened her eyes.

"Calmer," she said. "Maybe because someone finally talked to me like a person, not a candidate."

His mouth twitched like he wanted to laugh and decided against it.

"After tomorrow," he said, "if something feels wrong, don't ignore it."

She held his gaze.

"You think I will change like Kalani."

"I think no one comes back from that hall the same."

The truth of that sat between them all afternoon.

They walked once around the outer fence line where he had taught her to identify tracks by depth and spacing, then sat in shade while village elder pretended not to watch them.

Before she left, Alcuin pressed a carved wooden bird into her hand, rough shape, one wing uneven.

"Keep it in your sleeve," he said. "So tomorrow isn't only theirs."

She closed her fingers around it.

"Come with me to the barrier," she said.

He did.

At the threshold, he stopped where he always had to stop.

"Come back whole," he said.

Ksena stepped into barrier light.

"I'll try."

On city side, air felt thinner again.

She did not look back until she reached the second corridor gate.

Alcuin was still standing at the boundary stone, smaller in distance than she wanted him to be.

By evening curfew, she had hidden his carved bird in ritual sleeve lining and tied her hair for preparation check.

Tomorrow she would stand before a crystal shaped by people who called this village primitive and this friendship dangerous.

Tonight she remembered how real she felt outside the walls.

It made what waited inside them harder to accept.
