Pictures flashed in her mind, over and over only lasting for a second before changing to the next, the images we're all different and moving so fast Ksena could barley take in any features, her people, the tribes people, a specifies she did not know, war damage ascension and it was over, leaving Ksena gasping and staring at the floor as sweat dripped off her to fall onto floor, was she ascended was it over, had her sister and mother also gone through this
Ksena heard a gasp come from her sister overseeing the ceremony, she eyes we're wide with shock as she gazed over her sister"s body, where she should have been gaped in the power from her ascension there was nothing, her sister remaining the same collapsed onto her hands and knees on the floor.
"Seize her" Her mother called out and Ksena felt two hands grab and lift her up, pinning her hands painfully behind her, Ksena looked around, focusing on her mother as she squirmed trying to break free, what are they doing, what did her mother say
"Take her to the prison her mother motioned to the guards holding there, Ksena screamed as they dragged her from the ritual area, she called out to her mother and her sister standing before her, her sister took a step towards her but was stopped by their mother, "She has failed the ritual, she is no longer one of us" Ksena sister looked again at her sister, before straightening up and bowing to their mother, Ksena collapsed into the two guards hands the fight taken out of her at her mothers words and her sisters acceptance.

The ritual was simple, Ksena had been there when her sister went through her ritual, it nearly seemed to simple, there was a crystal the person taking the ritual simply laid their hands on it, and if it all goes correct, they are suddenly dressed in flames like most of the other ascendant.
Ksena had been so excited to see her sister, but as soon her sister went away with the elder and after that she was never the same again
The other source of nerves for Ksena was the person leading the ritual, her father, she had not seen him since the last ritual with her sister, her father was the leader, very busy he also had his own house and lived separated from them, it was not to unusual Ksena and her sisters are not the only children in the town
Her mother, father and sister would be at the ritual, but it was not the same as the last time she was here, there congratulations felt more like something they had to do and not heart warming, at least Alcuin had been supportive, without that Ksena did not think she could go through with this, at least it would be over soon
“Ksena, it is time. Place both your hands on the ritual stone and be awakened!”
Ksena approached the stone her hands already reaching out, she just had to lay her hands, and it was over, Ksena pressed forward and grasps the ritual stone in both hands, and time seem to spot, she saw flashing images in her head; they we're too fast to make any sense; she saw aliens she had never heard of, fights between them and ascended, the images kept repeating thousands of them, seeming to last only a second before changing, Ksena was flunk from the crystal and collapsed into a pile, the room was silent no one spoke as Ksena took hazard breathes, Ksena tried to sit up but she had no energy and quickly feel back again hitting her head and knocking herself out, the images continued the plague her dreams, even unconscious her body racked with pain
When Ksena awoke, it was not in her own bed; she did not recognize the room; it was empty with just a bed and a door, bringing her hand up to her pounding head, Ksena struggled to grasp any thoughts, the ritual, she looked down at herself she did not differ from before, something had happened her awakening had failed, and now she was in a room, hesitatingly getting to her feet Ksena stumbled to the door, grabbing the handle she pulled it and it would not budge, she called out but heard nothing, her strength gave out as she collapsed by the door, fading into unconscious again.

When she awoke again, her father was in the room with her. He was leaning against the far wall and watching her. Her head felt a little better. It was still pounding, Father. what happened?
Her father looked down at her. His face seemed to be emotionalists like he was observing the results from a project.. One that failed,
Ksena sat up on the bed slowly to stop the world from spinning too fast,
“Where I am I?”
To that question he spoke up,
"you are in jail" he said coolly
"Jail? What happened? Why am I in jail?”
He thought about it long enough that Ksena did not even think he would answer
"you are the first fail in the ritual, why?"
 the question was asked, but she knew he did not expect an answer, just stating it out loud
Can I do the ritual again? Ksena asked panicky, without the ritual, what was she..
"No, can"t risk damaging the crystal"
"How long will I be in prison?” Ksena asked. Her father was giving her nothing to go off
"Until I decide what to do with you, is this a one in a million chance or something that threatens us, until I know you will stay locked up?"
"Can I see my mother or sister?” Ksena asked. She did not even know why. She hoped they would offer her support.
No, they are too busy to deal with you
"But she is my”
Ksena did not even have time to finish
"Silence, for now you will stay here and wait for my decision.”
The night before the ritual, Ksena was kept in a preparation chamber with two attendants and no windows. They brushed her hair, tied ceremonial bands around her wrists, and spoke in the same careful tone people used near unstable fire.

"Keep your breathing even," one said.

"Do not remove your hands until instructed," said the other.

"Do not speak unless asked."

She nodded through all of it, though her mind kept drifting to the village and Alcuin's good luck chant.

At dawn they led her through a narrow corridor into the ritual hall.

It was larger than she remembered from watching Kalani's ceremony. Maybe fear made spaces bigger.

Her father stood by the crystal with the elders in a ring. Her mother and sister waited behind them in full flame dress, not close enough to touch.

She wanted to run to them anyway.

Instead she followed the marks on the floor and knelt where instructed.

The crystal looked ordinary from a distance. Up close it seemed to pull light inward.

"Candidate Ksena," her father intoned, "state your name and pledge."

She did.

"Approach."

She rose, stepped forward, and placed both palms on the stone.

The first sensation was heat. The second was pressure behind her eyes. The third was impossible speed: images tearing through her mind faster than thought.

Cities she had never seen. Skies split by fire. Creatures in armor unlike anything in city records. Ascendants fighting shoulder to shoulder with tribe warriors. Then those same groups divided, shouting, turning on each other.

The images did not stop.

She tried to breathe and nearly choked.

Somewhere far away she heard the ritual master call for alignment. Another voice shouted correction. Someone said hold her. Someone else said no.

Then she was on the floor with her hands ripped free and a taste of blood in her mouth where she'd bitten her lip.

When she forced her eyes open, there we're no flames around her body.

Only silence.

Then her mother's command: "Seize her."

The guards dragged her before she could understand what had happened.

As they pulled her away, Ksena saw Kalani start forward, stopped by a hand at her shoulder. Kalani's face looked stricken, then blank.

The blankness hurt most.

In confinement, hours blurred. She woke, slept, woke again. The images kept returning whenever she closed her eyes.

When her father finally appeared, she asked him what she had done wrong.

He asked only one question in return.

"Why did you resist?"

"I didn't mean to."

"Meaning is irrelevant. Outcome is not."

She asked if she could retry the ritual.

"No," he said. "The crystal is not to be stressed again."

She asked for her mother.

"Denied."

She asked for Kalani.

"Denied."

He turned to leave, then paused at the door.

"You are no longer protected by status," he said. "Remember that."

After he left, Ksena curled on the narrow bed and repeated one thought until it felt like an anchor.

I did not fail by choice.

By the next morning that thought was all she had.
