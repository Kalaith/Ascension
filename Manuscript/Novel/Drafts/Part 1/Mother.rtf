\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ksena mother felt off, her daughter had failed and after her other daughter had been so successful, she thought she was blessed with two gifted children, but everything was falling apart, Kalani was defiantly gifted, but something with the power had changed her, she wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t the same girl as before the ritual, everyone changed a little, but she went from sweet to terrifying and so quickly, and now her other daughter was exiled from the village after failing her ritual, it still made little sense, something was defiantly off, her only relief was the fact that her daughter was actually free, she had always been too advantage to the savages, she had tried to warn her away but Ksena just kept visiting, and now she could never go home, she could never embrace her child again, and with the news that she was scouting out ancient ritual sites these had been forbidden to all savages, they didn\u8217\'92t even try to argue it with them, if a savage went to one of the ancient temples, their tribe was usually erased from existence}
