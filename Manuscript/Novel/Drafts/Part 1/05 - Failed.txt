“She resisted. The ritual failed. What do we kill her? We need to find out why, tribes fault, we should kill them all. She is the first to resist her mother and sister did not although our control over her sister is tedious; she follows our orders as much for her own reasons than ours, are they building an immunity, we should find out, we still need the village for food, let's banish them both the villager and the girl, and we can find out if they had outside help, anyone they interact we kill. Are we decided, vote, she is banished, the village will be ordered to banish their own or they will be eradicated.”
The chamber doors sealed with a low hum after the last elder entered. The ritual hall had been cleansed, but the smell of burned incense and hot stone still hung in the air. In the center of the room, the crystal sat in its cradle of black metal, dull now, almost offended. It should have been bright after a successful ascension. It should have been singing with power. Instead it sat quiet while twelve figures took their places around the ring, their flames low and controlled.

No one spoke for several breaths.

The First Elder broke the silence. "State what happened. No embellishment."

The ritual master bowed his head once. "Candidate Ksena entered the circle on time. Oath was spoken. Contact with the crystal was stable for the opening sequence. During the extraction phase, resistance escalated. Her flame pattern desynchronized from the ring. She did not submit."

"Did she lose consciousness?" another elder asked.

"No."

"Did she panic?"

"No. She looked confused, then focused."

A murmur rolled through the ring.

The First Elder lifted a hand. "Order. Continue."

"At the moment we pushed for alignment," the ritual master said, "she pushed back. Not with skill. With instinct. The crystal failed to lock. We terminated to prevent cascade failure."

A narrow-faced elder leaned forward. "She attacked the circle?"

"No."

"Then why are we speaking as if we survived an assassination?" the elder snapped. "A failed child ritual is not new."

"Resistance at that stage is new," someone answered from the far side. "And you know it."

The chamber tension sharpened.

"What did she see?" the First Elder asked.

The ritual master hesitated. "Unknown. She described fragments before containment. Tribes and city together. Foreign ships. Ancient war imagery."

Three elders cursed under their breath.

"Memory bleed," one whispered.

"Impossible," said another.

"Not impossible," the First Elder said quietly. "Unacceptable."

A different voice entered the discussion, hard and practical. "If the child resisted, then either her will is unusually strong, or conditioning has weakened in that bloodline. Her sister remains compliant but increasingly selective in execution. The mother performs duties cleanly but asks too many questions."

That pulled every gaze to the speaker.

"Say what you mean," the First Elder said.

"I mean this may not be an isolated failure. I mean we may have drift in the line."

The words landed like a hammer.

One elder struck the arm of his chair with a closed fist. "Then purge them."

Another immediately countered, "If we purge one of the oldest ceremonial lines, we trigger panic in half the city."

"Then purge quietly."

"Nothing is quiet in this city anymore."

"Enough," the First Elder said. "We need sequence, not noise."

He stood and walked toward the crystal. The surface reflected his flame in warped bands.

"We have three concerns," he said. "First, immediate containment of candidate Ksena. Second, cause analysis. Third, external risk through tribal contact. We solve in that order."

The ritual master nodded. "Candidate is confined."

"Not for long," a woman elder replied. "Her mother will ask for a private audience. Her sister already requested one and was denied."

"Deny again."

"That will create suspicion."

"Suspicion is already here," someone muttered.

The First Elder turned. "Then we offer explanation. She has been selected for remedial pilgrimage."

"To where?"

"Ancient sites. The story is old enough to sound respectable and vague enough to be useful."

Several elders exchanged glances. That was dangerous ground.

"If you send her out," said the narrow-faced elder, "you lose control of observation."

"If we keep her in," answered the First Elder, "we create a martyr among youth, and we force everyone to ask why an unascended daughter of a ranking house is treated like a criminal."

No one had an answer to that.

"Then kill her in transit," came a cold suggestion from the back.

The chamber went still.

"Rejected," the First Elder said instantly.

"On what grounds?"

"On strategic grounds. A dead daughter creates an enemy in the mother and volatility in the sister. Also, if she is carrying residual memory echo, I want to know why before she dies."

He paused, measuring faces.

"We are not amateurs slaughtering animals in the dark. We govern."

The rebuked elder looked away but did not apologize.

A younger council member cleared his throat. "The tribal factor remains. She has frequent unsanctioned contact with the outer village. Their hunters have tolerated her because we tolerated her. If she resists us and then returns to them, it becomes narrative."

"A narrative of what?" the First Elder asked.

"That ascension can fail. That the city is not absolute. That our rituals are coercive, not sacred."

That sentence hit even harder than the first.

"So isolate both sides," said the ritual master. "Issue directive to tribal elder: expel the girl and one escort. Any refusal is treason against city protection accords."

"One escort?"

"Yes. If she travels alone she dies quickly and unpredictably. If she travels with one person, she survives long enough to be observed and remains limited in capability."

"Who do we force?"

"Let the tribe choose. Choice creates ownership. Ownership creates compliance."

The First Elder gave a short nod of approval.

"And if the tribe hides her?" someone asked.

"Then we burn one village as example," said the narrow-faced elder.

A grim silence followed.

The First Elder did not object. "Only if necessary. Resource flow must be preserved."

An elder with silver flames folded her hands. "What about the mother? She will ask why her daughter is treated as defective stock."

"Tell her this is mercy," the First Elder said. "Tell her exile gives the girl a path to return if she unlocks naturally."

"A lie."

"A useful one."

"And the sister?"

"Keep her occupied with patrol and barrier reinforcement. Praise her publicly. Isolate her privately. If she asks direct questions, redirect to duty."

The ritual master looked uneasy for the first time. "We are stretching control."

"Yes," the First Elder said. "Which is why we act with precision."

He turned back toward the ring and raised his voice.

"Formal motion. Candidate Ksena is declared failed in controlled ascension. Candidate is removed from city citizenship and reassigned to external pilgrimage under tribal escort. Tribal authority is ordered to expel and provision under compliance clause seven. Any third party aiding candidate beyond agreed terms is categorized as external threat."

"Seconded," said the narrow-faced elder.

"Seconded," echoed two others.

"Vote."

One by one, flames rose from each seat. Some burned bright and eager. Some lifted reluctantly. Two elders hesitated long enough to be noticed, then gave assent.

"Motion carried," the First Elder said.

The ritual master exhaled slowly.

"Next motion," the First Elder continued. "Silence protocol. No public mention of resistance, memory bleed, or ritual desynchronization. Official record states incomplete attunement and compassionate reassignment."

That vote passed faster.

"Now operational assignments," he said.

He began naming names. One elder would prepare the script for the mother. Another would draft the order to the tribal chief. A third would activate watchers along the plains routes. The ritual master would inspect the crystal for instability and report before sunrise.

When he finished, he dismissed the ring, but no one moved immediately.

Finally the silver-flamed elder spoke, voice low. "If this repeats?"

The First Elder looked at the dark crystal.

"Then we stop treating it as accident," he said. "And we start treating it as war."

The chamber broke apart after that. Robes rustled. Doors opened. Flames dimmed.

Outside the council chamber, two guards waited with heads bowed. They did not ask what had been decided. They did not need to. One took the sealed order tube and ran toward the outer gate relay. The other headed toward the residential quarter where the tribal messenger would be summoned before dawn.

By midnight, the story had already changed.

By morning, it would be law.

In a side corridor, the ritual master stopped alone beneath a narrow window slit where the moonlight fell across the stone. He pressed his palm against the wall to steady himself.

He could still see Ksena’s face from the circle. Not rage. Not madness. Recognition.

As if she had remembered something she was never supposed to know.

He pushed the thought down and kept walking.

At the far end of the district, a scribe sat at a long table and copied the official declaration in clean, elegant script:

"By authority of the Council, candidate Ksena is reassigned under mercy doctrine following incomplete ascension alignment."

Mercy doctrine.

The scribe paused before sealing it, then added one final line dictated by the First Elder’s office:

"The village is required to comply. Noncompliance will be interpreted as hostile intent."

Wax stamped. Thread tied. Delivered.

Before first light, a messenger crossed the barrier path toward the tribal lands.

By sunrise, the village elder would be awake, and the order would be in his hands.

By sunset, two young people would be walking into the plains with packs on their backs, one exiled by decree, the other by consequence.

The council called it stability.

The city called it necessity.

No one called it what it was.

Fear.
