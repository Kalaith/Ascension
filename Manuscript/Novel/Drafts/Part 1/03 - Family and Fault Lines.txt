The city called them her family.

Ksena sometimes wondered if the word meant the same thing to everyone.

Her mother commanded outer-defense cohorts and moved through the city like a blade held in perfect alignment. Her father sat among the elder ring and appeared in public only when ritual law or military doctrine required his voice. Kalani, older by two years, had become ascended and begun speaking in the same measured cadence as both of them. Their oldest sister had ascended earlier and vanished into internal command postings.

All four loved Ksena in the way duty allowed.

None of them knew what to do with her when she asked questions without strategic purpose. Silence had become the family language.

At first bell on ritual day, Kalani escorted her to preparation wing.

No jokes.

No hand squeeze.

No "you'll be fine."

Only checklist language.

"Breathing patterns reviewed?"

"Yes."

"Ceremonial restraints secured?"

"Yes."

"Sleeve clear of contraband?"

Ksena's fingers twitched over the hidden bird token.

"Yes," she lied.

Kalani studied her face, then tapped the scanner plate herself before the attendant could. The plate flashed amber, logged override, and reset to green.

"Clear," Kalani said.

In preparation chamber, attendants removed her outer robe, painted control marks on wrists, and repeated ritual directives with mechanical calm.

Do not break hand contact.

Do not speak unless addressed.

Do not resist guidance channels.

Ksena nodded through each line while her stomach tightened.

When chamber doors opened, she was led into crystal hall on third bell.

The room was larger than memory and colder than expected.

Elders stood in ring formation.

Ritual master waited by pedestal.

Her father stood opposite the entrance in full council flame.

Her mother and Kalani stood behind the ring, close enough to see, too far to touch.

"Candidate Ksena," ritual master called. "State your name and pledge."

She did.

"Approach."

She stepped to the pedestal and placed both palms on the crystal.

Heat came first.

Then pressure behind the eyes.

Then images.

Cities under fire.

Sky crowded with unknown ships.

Ascendants and tribal fighters standing together.

Then turning on each other.

The sequence accelerated until she could not tell memory from warning.

Channel pressure increased.

Hands she could not see pushed at her mind from twelve directions, trying to align thought and output into expected pattern.

Something in her resisted.

Not strategy.

Instinct.

She tried to breathe through it.

Pressure became force.

The crystal flared, then bucked hard enough to rattle the floor.

Someone shouted to terminate.

Energy snapped across ring channels.

Ksena was thrown backward and hit stone shoulder first.

The hall lights dimmed.

Silence followed like impact.

Ritual master stood over her, face pale beneath controlled flame.

"Do not move," he said.

She moved anyway, pushing to one knee.

"What happened?"

No one answered.

Her father signaled warding guards.

Two stepped forward.

Kalani took half a step toward Ksena and stopped when her mother's hand caught her wrist.

Ksena saw it.

Kalani saw her seeing it.

Then both looked away.

She was escorted from the hall under restraint protocols usually reserved for unstable output cases.

In holding chamber, no one explained failure language. No one said whether she was injured, dangerous, or already judged.

Hours passed measured only by bell vibrations through the wall.

When the door finally opened, her mother entered alone.

Ksena stood too fast.

"Tell me," she said. "Did I fail?"

Her mother's jaw tightened.

"The council is in session."

"That means yes."

Her mother did not answer.

"Did I do something wrong?"

A long pause.

"You did something unexpected," her mother said.

Ksena took one step forward.

"What does that mean?"

"It means keep your head down until judgment is delivered," her mother said. "Speak less. Observe more."

The door opened behind her. A guard signaled time.

Her mother turned to leave, then stopped with her hand on the frame.

"Whatever happens next," she said without looking back, "remember who you are when they describe you to yourself."

Then she left.

Ksena stood alone in holding light, shoulder throbbing, palms still warm from crystal contact, and understood with a certainty that made her nauseous.

This had stopped being a ceremony.

It was now a trial.
