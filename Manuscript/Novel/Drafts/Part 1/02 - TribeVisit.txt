Ksena looked around nervously, keeping low between carved garden walls while patrol routes crossed ahead of her. Sneaking out of the city was forbidden, especially the day before ritual, but she needed to see Alcuin once more.

Tomorrow she would stand in the crystal hall and become what everyone expected. Today still felt like hers.

She slipped through the final corridor and reached the barrier edge. Warm light pulsed over her skin as she stepped through, the city glow fading behind her.

Outside, the world opened immediately. Wind through grass. Bird calls. Real noise instead of disciplined silence.

The village sat beyond the tree line, close enough to trade with the city and far enough to remain separate. Most people in the city called them primitives. Ksena had never believed that.

As she crossed the last rise, Alcuin was already waiting near the path marker, arms folded, trying and failing to look casual.

"You are late," he said.

"You are dramatic," Ksena answered, then smiled despite herself.

He guided her through village lanes while morning work began around them. Fires were lit, children ran between huts, and no one moved in the measured choreography of the city.

It always felt wrong how quickly she relaxed here.

They stopped near the water trough where she and Kalani used to meet him before Kalani's ritual changed everything.

"I kept hoping she'd come back with you one day," Alcuin said quietly.

Ksena looked away. "I did too."

Before noon, the village elder pulled Ksena aside and studied her face.

"Do you trust the people who will touch the crystal?" the elder asked.

Ksena did not answer quickly enough.

The elder nodded once, as if the silence told him everything.

Later, Alcuin brought her to a mat circle near the edge huts.

"Kneel," he said. "This one is for luck."

On the ground he had arranged three small stones and a strip of woven grass cord in a pattern she did not recognize. When she asked what it meant, he only told her to close her eyes.

His voice dropped into old village dialect, uneven at first, then steady as he repeated the same line. Ksena caught fragments but not enough to translate all of it.

When he stopped, the silence felt louder than the chant.

"Anything?" he asked.

"Calmer," she said. "Or maybe I wanted to feel calmer."

"I'll take either."

She looked at the stones again. "What did you ask for?"

"Clear judgment when fear is louder than sense."

He held her gaze. "After tomorrow, if something feels wrong, don't ignore it."

She watched him for a long moment. "You think I'll change like Kalani did."

"I think no one comes back from that hall the same."

They sat with that between them until the afternoon shadows lengthened.

When she stood to leave, Alcuin handed her a rough carved token shaped like a bird, one wing uneven.

"Keep it in your sleeve," he said. "So tomorrow isn't only theirs."

She closed her fingers around it.

"It's a promise," she said. "I'll come back."

At the barrier, he stopped where he always had to stop.

"Come back whole," he said.

Ksena stepped through the light and did not answer until she was already on the city side.

"I'll try."

When she re-entered the city, the air felt filtered and thin. Patrol bells marked the afternoon cycle. No one asked where she had been.

In her room, she laid out ceremonial cloth, the herb bundle from the village, and the carved bird. Three objects from three worlds that refused to fit together.

She hid the bird in her ritual sleeve anyway.

Before dawn, she washed in cold water, tied her hair, and walked toward the ritual hall on first bell.

The stone floor inside was colder than she expected. It steadied her more than the prayers did.

One step, then another, she crossed the threshold without looking back.

Only the crystal waited ahead.
