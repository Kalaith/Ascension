She is the first to resist her mother and sister did not although our control over her sister is tedious; she follows our orders as much for her own reasons than ours, are they building an immunity, we should find out, we still need the village for food, let's banish them both the villager and the girl, and we can find out if they had outside help, anyone they interact we kill.
