The outpost looked temporary until Ksena stayed long enough to notice how permanent the routines were.

Canvas roofs patched over old stone foundations.

Trade fires burning in shifts.

Guards pretending to be merchants and merchants pretending not to notice.

Alcuin lowered his voice as they approached.

"We keep it simple. Buy food. Ask route questions. Leave before dark."

Ksena pulled her hood lower.

"And if someone asks where we're from?"

"We lie less than they do."

The central market lane was crowded with hunters, trappers, cart teams, and two different village dialects shouting over fish prices.

Ksena felt eyes on them before she found the source.

A woman in travel leathers leaned against a supply post, watching Alcuin the way predators watch weather.

Not hostile.

Interested.

She pushed off the post and crossed directly to them.

"You need a guide," she said.

Alcuin did not flinch.

"Do we?"

"If you're heading north-east ruin belt, yes."

Ksena and Alcuin exchanged one quick look.

The woman smiled, satisfied she'd guessed right.

"Name's Estele," she said. "Best tracker in this dump and better company than half these drunks."

"We didn't announce destination," Alcuin said.

"You didn't need to. Your boots say ruins, your map wrap says old ink, and your friend there walks like she's trying not to look like someone important."

Ksena straightened despite herself.

"How much?"

Estele named a number high enough to be insulting.

Alcuin gave her a look that said no chance.

She shrugged.

"Price includes alive arrival. Discount option is you die cheaper."

Ksena almost laughed.

Almost.

They haggled for ten minutes and settled on mixed payment: two polished stones from Ksena's hidden pouch, one metal clasp from Alcuin's gear, plus shared game rights for three travel days.

Estele checked the stones against light and tucked them away.

"Deal. We leave at first light."

"No," Alcuin said. "We leave now."

Estele raised a brow.

"Urgent?"

"Necessary."

She looked from him to Ksena and back.

"Fine. But route control is mine. You break formation, I leave you."

"Understood," Ksena said.

They stocked quickly.

Dried meat.

Water skins.

Spare bowstring.

Herb paste for cuts and bites.

While Alcuin handled pack weight, Estele pulled Ksena aside between two stalls.

"He's loyal to you," she said, not unkindly.

Ksena kept her expression neutral.

"We're keeping each other alive."

"That's not what I asked."

Ksena looked toward Alcuin and felt the old ache she had no time for.

"It's what I can answer."

Estele studied her, then nodded once.

"Fair."

They cleared the outpost before sunset and cut across low scrub toward ridge line.

Estele moved fast and silent, reading terrain at a level Ksena had only seen in Alcuin.

By second watch camp, Ksena knew two things:

Estele was worth the price.

And Estele wanted more than payment.

Alcuin knew it too.

He caught Ksena's glance across the fire and gave the smallest shrug.

Later, after Estele took first watch and wind shifted cold from the north, Ksena lay awake staring at the dark and replaying the map from the hidden station.

One route led to answers.

Several led to death.

Now they had a guide with sharp eyes, sharper instincts, and unknown motives.

It was still better than walking blind.

At dawn, Estele kicked dirt over the fire and pointed toward broken ridges ahead.

"Temple line starts there," she said. "Stay close and try not to step on anything that bites."

They moved out in single file.

By midday, Ksena stopped feeling like an exile and started feeling like part of a hunting party aimed at history.

She was not sure which was more dangerous.
