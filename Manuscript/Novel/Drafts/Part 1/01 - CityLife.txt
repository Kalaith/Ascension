There weren't a lot of children in the city at all. I think they were worried about over population since they didn't want to expand the city, or couldn't

There was two other girls Ksena age, but children didn't really play, there were no communal birthdays, both of the girls didn't have other siblings unlike Ksena, so they was more reversed, they would never consider leaving the city for example, to go outside and visit the natives
Apart from these two girls, for the next ritual well it wouldn't happen, no one was coming of age, for at least 5 years, so there was no one around Ksena, when her sister became ascended, Ksena spent more and more time outside of the city, spending time with the natives, they had many children, younger and older than well as the same age, and since she was ascended, it gave her a popularity with the children in the village.

But this wasn't the only reason, one problem was age, her mother was hundreds of years old, and the elders where the elders when the city was first built, even Ksena would not age, they didn't seem to age much past 25 years old, even the eldest elder looked young and energetic, they avoided the villages because they would outlive them, Ksena didn't really think of this at her age.

In the village the oldest elder had just turned 60, a child compared to Ksena mother, no one really explained this to her, maybe this was something that became apparent in the ritual, they realized they would live if not forever a an extreme length of time, Kalani always wanted to be a mother before her ascension ritual, but that type of contact was not allowed for hundreds of years

Maybe Kalani got jealous after her ritual, seeing all her old friends get to have a full life, while she was just hitting the start of hers, although the long life didn't explain a few things to Ksena, why was her sister so busy, she had hundreds if not thousands of years to train, everyone was always busy, no one had time for children, at home this was all Ksena had to think about, at least visiting the village she was having fun.

Ksena didn't really talk to her mother, from when she was old enough her sister was there, and when she sister joined her mother she was left alone, Ksena know of her father, but that was it the elders did not browse around the city, they stayed meditating all day and night

Morning in the city began with bells that were more ceremonial than useful. Ksena woke before the second bell because she always did. The room she slept in was neat, square, and almost identical to every room in her district. A bed, a folded blanket, one shelf, one water basin. No clutter, no toys left on the floor, no sign that a child had ever lived there unless you knew where to look.

She kept a stack of carved tokens under the bed, little animals made from scrap wood she traded from village children. She pulled one out now, a rough fox with uneven ears, and held it in her hand while she waited for the third bell.

That bell meant movement.

Doors opened along the corridor in sequence. Women and men in quiet flame robes walked toward assigned stations. No one ran. No one joked. No one yawned. Every motion was controlled and practiced.

Ksena stepped into the flow and followed it toward the shared kitchen hall, where she was expected to prepare morning broth for herself and record consumption for her household log. Most ascended adults barely ate. They drank a little, consumed enough to satisfy appearances, then returned to work.

It had never made sense to her.

The kitchen hall was clean enough to shine in the dim light. Twelve heating stones lined the center bench. She lit one and watched the flame take.

Two girls her age entered from the west door, the same two who would attend ritual with her. They always moved together as if tied by a thread.

"Morning," Ksena said.

One nodded politely. The other gave a tight smile. "Morning. Are you ready?"

"I think so."

"My mother says if we panic, the crystal punishes hesitation," the first girl said.

Ksena tried to laugh. "That sounds encouraging."

Neither girl laughed back.

"Afterward we get assignments," the second said. "My aunt says I can petition for perimeter division."

"I want to do barrier maintenance," the first added.

They looked at Ksena, waiting.

She stared at the heating stone. "I don't know."

The second girl frowned slightly. "You don't know?"

"I haven't decided yet."

That answer sounded wrong in the room, like she had spoken a forbidden language.

"You should decide before council asks," the first girl said. "It looks weak if you don't."

Ksena smiled thinly and changed the subject. "Did either of you sleep?"

"No," both answered at the same time.

At least that part was honest.

After breakfast she was sent to courtyard duty, trimming the vine lines along the northern wall. The city gardens were beautiful from above and strange from inside. Every plant had a number, every path had a measured width, every bloom had to be pruned to a preferred shape. Nothing wild survived long here.

While she worked, she watched patrols pass along the upper walkways. Flame uniforms moved in perfect intervals. Two steps, scan left, scan right, continue. It looked less like protection and more like rehearsal.

A supervisor passed and inspected her trim line.

"Too uneven," he said, barely glancing. "Again."

She redid it.

When he returned, he said nothing, which counted as approval.

At midmorning she was released and headed toward her mother's quarters, hoping to catch her before assignment drill.

Kalani emerged first.

Ksena almost did not recognize her sister at a distance anymore. Kalani had always carried herself proudly, but now every movement looked sharpened, like someone had carved the softness out of her.

"You are late," Kalani said.

"For what?"

"Father asked all ritual candidates to report before noon."

Ksena blinked. "No one told me."

"Then now you know."

Ksena hesitated. "Can we talk first?"

Kalani checked the corridor behind her, then sighed. "Briefly."

"After your ritual, did everything feel... wrong?"

Kalani's eyes flicked to Ksena's face, then away. "Wrong how?"

"Like everyone expected you to be someone else overnight."

"That is exactly what happened," Kalani said. "Why are you asking now?"

"Because everyone keeps saying congratulations like I'm already gone."

For a moment Kalani looked like she might say something real. Then footsteps sounded at the corridor bend and the expression shut.

"You will adjust," she said in her formal voice. "Do not embarrass us in front of father."

She walked away before Ksena could answer.

Father's antechamber smelled of stone dust and burning resin. Three candidates waited in silence, hands folded, backs straight. When they were called one by one, each entered and emerged within minutes with the same distant expression.

Ksena entered last.

Her father stood at the far end beside a low table covered in ritual tablets. He did not offer a seat.

"Candidate Ksena," he said. "State your understanding of tomorrow's process."

She recited what every child learned. Contact, alignment, awakening, oath, assignment.

"And your role after awakening?"

"Service to city and council."

"Without hesitation?"

She hesitated anyway. A heartbeat only.

"Yes," she said.

His eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. "Hesitation is disorder. Disorder is breach."

"I understand."

"Do you?" he asked.

The question carried weight beyond words.

"Yes," she said again, because she did not know what answer was safe.

He dismissed her with a nod and turned to the next tablet before she reached the door.

Outside, she exhaled for what felt like the first time all day.

In the afternoon she slipped toward the outer district under the excuse of collecting linen rolls. She did collect the linen, then took the long path near the barrier gardens where she could see the shimmer of the city wall through the trees.

From this side the barrier looked beautiful. From the village side it looked like a prison.

She had learned that difference from Alcuin.

At the edge path she found a younger child from the city sitting alone with knees hugged to chest. He looked up when she approached.

"Are you doing ritual tomorrow?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Will it hurt?"

She sat beside him. "I don't know."

"My brother said you stop being scared forever after."

Ksena watched the barrier pulse. "If that's true, I think I'd rather keep a little fear."

The child frowned, unsure whether that was a joke.

"If I become ascended," she asked him, "what should I do first?"

He considered seriously. "Climb the tower everyone says we can't climb."

She laughed, genuine this time. "That's a good answer."

By evening she returned home and found her mother waiting with folded ceremonial cloth.

"Try this," her mother said. "If it is too loose at the shoulders, I will pin it."

Ksena obeyed while her mother adjusted seams with efficient hands.

"You barely ate today," her mother said without looking up.

"I wasn't hungry."

"Eat anyway."

"Did you feel afraid before yours?"

Her mother paused, then resumed pinning. "Yes."

"Did you tell anyone?"

"No."

"Why?"

"Because in this city, fear is treated like weakness until fear is useful."

Ksena absorbed that in silence.

"Do you want me to say you'll be fine?" her mother asked quietly.

Ksena nodded.

Her mother finished pinning, stepped back, and met her eyes. "You'll be fine."

The words sounded true and not true at the same time.

Night came. The bells marked final curfew. Windows dimmed district by district.

Ksena lay awake in her plain room listening to the city breathe through stone: distant boots on walkways, a door seal hissing shut, someone murmuring a prayer two rooms over.

She took the carved fox from under the bed and turned it in her hand.

Tomorrow she would place both palms on the crystal and step into the life everyone had planned for her before she could spell her own name.

She tried to picture herself after.

All she saw was fire.

And behind the fire, a door she could not yet open.
