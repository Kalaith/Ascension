her mother was here, have they come to let her out, she hoped, so this had been a horrible nightmare, the ritual failed and the images still flashed in her, trying to tell her something, but she couldn't understand them, they made no sense, her people and the tribes together, a foreign enemy invasion, combat explosions what did it all mean, the elders why they sat around her channeling, a wall the spell interrupted

"Why am I being exiled? It was an order from them, Ksena failed her Ascension ritual and they think we might have been the cause, and we have to exile the person responsible, or they will destroy the village and we will also be homeless, but you can't do this my family and home are here, everything."
"It doesn't matter I must exile someone for the sake of the village, if you can pick someone else that should be sent out with her, let me know the world is still wild and without her powers she will be an easy target on the plains"
"You must know it's an order. You are here by exile from the village. Collect your things tomorrow. We will take you and her to the boundaries of our land, and you're on your own after that."
"where will I go, what will I do?"
"The homeland of our people would be the best place, even as not ascended. I am sure they can find a place for her there, and you as we'll."
"Leave now, say your goodbyes, unless she becomes ascended under her own power. I doubt they will ever let her back in the city. You as we'll, now leave."
The order arrived before midday, carried by a city runner who would not step beyond the first line of huts. He waited near the old trade post with his chin raised and the arrogance of a boy wearing borrowed authority.

The village elder met him with two hunters at his side and took the sealed tube without a word. The runner did not bow. He recited instead.

"By command of the Council, compliance is required before sunset tomorrow. Candidate Ksena is to be expelled from city-adjacent lands. One assigned companion is to accompany candidate beyond the boundary. This is not negotiable."

The elder stared at him. "And if we refuse?"

The boy swallowed once, then repeated the line exactly as trained. "Noncompliance will be interpreted as hostile intent."

The hunters stiffened. Everyone in the village knew what hostile intent meant when spoken by the city.

Fire.

The elder dismissed the runner with a flat nod. "You have your answer by dusk."

"I only carry orders," the boy said, suddenly less certain.

"Then carry this one back," the elder replied. "Go."

When the runner left, the elder stood in silence with the wax seal still warm in his hand. He had seen these orders before. Never this close to home.

He called a council immediately.

By the time Ksena and Alcuin we're brought to the meeting hut, every elder and head hunter was already present. No one smiled. No one offered tea.

Ksena felt the weight in the room before anyone spoke.

Alcuin stepped half a pace forward without thinking, placing himself between her and the elders. The elder noticed and said nothing.

"You asked why," he said, voice rough from too many long winters. "Now you will hear it in full."

He read the order aloud.

Each word felt colder than the last.

When he finished, Ksena stood very still, as if movement might make the sentence real.

"So I am being exiled from the city," she said quietly. "And now from here too."

The elder did not soften. "Yes."

"For failing?"

"For surviving it," Alcuin muttered.

A few hunters looked away, because he was right.

Ksena turned to the elder. "You said the world is dangerous. You said without my powers I won't last. Why send me out then?"

"Because if we don't, none of us last," he answered.

The bluntness stung more than anger would have.

"We trade food and hides for their protection," the head hunter added. "That protection was never free."

Ksena's eyes burned. "Then your protection is a cage."

"Yes," the elder said. "And cages still keep beasts out."

Alcuin clenched his jaw so hard it hurt.

"You could hide her," he said. "Send her north. Lie to them."

"And when they come searching?" the elder shot back. "When they count huts and mark children and decide one village is lesson enough?"

No one answered.

Outside, wind scraped dust across the doorway.

The elder's voice dropped. "I do not enjoy this. But I will not gamble this village on hope."

He looked at Alcuin then, not Ksena.

"The order allows one escort."

Alcuin understood before the words came.

"If she goes alone, she dies. If someone goes with her, she has a chance."

"You picked him already," one of the women hunters said.

"I picked no one," the elder replied. "The city told us to choose. I gave that choice to the village."

Several faces shifted. That had happened while Ksena was still confined.

"And they chose me," Alcuin said.

"Yes."

The room held silence like a held breath.

Ksena shook her head. "No. This is my fault. I go alone."

"You won't make it three days alone," Alcuin said.

"Then I don't make it."

"Don't be stupid," he snapped, then instantly regretted the sharpness when he saw her flinch.

He lowered his voice. "You are not dying because they are cowards."

The elder closed his eyes briefly. "This is settled. You leave at dawn. Pack light. Food for six days. Water skins, blankets, tools. You will be escorted to the outer stones. After that, you are on your own."

"Where do we go?" Ksena asked.

"If you can reach the old homeland ruins, there are still shelters in that region. Some tribes may trade if you keep your head low."

"And if we return?" Alcuin asked.

The elder took too long to answer.

"Do not return unless the city order changes."

That was as close to goodbye as they would get.

The meeting ended with no blessing.

Outside, word had already spread. Children peered from between huts. Women paused over cookfires. Men who had laughed with Alcuin on hunts now watched with hard faces, not hostile, but helpless.

Ksena felt like a stain people we're afraid to touch.

Alcuin pulled her toward his family hut.

"Pack now," he said.

"They voted me out."

"They voted to survive," he said, throwing a travel sack onto the floor. "There's a difference."

"It feels the same."

He stopped and looked at her. "I know."

They packed in silence at first. Dried meat. Flint. Coil rope. Needle kit. Two spare tunics each. Alcuin added a hunting knife and then another. Ksena tried to leave behind a small carved toy she had traded for years ago, then tucked it back in when he wasn't looking.

Near sunset, Alcuin's mother came to the doorway and stood there without entering.

"I heard," she said.

Alcuin did not look up. "Everyone heard."

She ignored the edge in his voice and addressed Ksena directly. "Eat before dark. Fear burns energy faster than walking."

Ksena nodded. "Thank you."

After a pause, the woman stepped in and set a folded cloth bundle on the mat. "Dried roots. Bitter tea leaves. For fever and stomach pain."

Alcuin finally looked at her. "You support this?"

"I support you returning alive," she said. "Support and approval are not the same thing."

He had no reply.

She rested a hand against his shoulder once, firm and brief, then left.

Night settled over the village with no songs. Even the usual drum practice near the central fire stayed quiet. People spoke in low voices, if they spoke at all.

Ksena sat outside on a log and watched sparks rise into darkness.

Alcuin joined her with two bowls of stew.

"I thought you hated this," she said as she took one.

"I hate many things," he answered. "I still eat."

She almost smiled.

For a while they listened to the wind moving through the hide roofs.

"You can still back out," she said.

"No."

"You could stay."

"No."

"Why?"

He stared into his bowl. "Because you looked at that council room like the ground disappeared. I know that feeling."

She swallowed hard.

"Also," he added with a weak attempt at humor, "you're terrible at setting snares."

That got a short laugh out of her, and that was enough.

Before dawn, the village gathered at the edge path almost by instinct. No speeches. No ceremony. Just witnesses.

The elder stood by the boundary stones with the head hunter and four escorts carrying spears. Their faces we're carved from stone.

Ksena arrived with her pack and hood up. Alcuin came beside her, his spear over one shoulder.

The elder held out a rolled map scrap marked with charcoal. "Two wells in this direction. Dry creek bed here. If storms hit, cut east for rock cover."

Ksena took it like it might vanish.

"You are still children," the elder said, voice barely audible. "That is what I hate most."

Alcuin gave a bitter half laugh. "Then tell them no."

"I already told them no," the elder replied. "This is what no bought us."

He stepped back.

"Walk."

They did.

The escorts took them as far as the final standing stone where village marks ended and open plains began. There, the head hunter planted his spear butt in the dust.

"Beyond this line," he said, "we did not see you."

He met Alcuin's eyes. "Do not make me lie badly."

Alcuin nodded once.

Ksena turned for one last look at the village. Smoke lifted from cookfires. Children clung to door frames. A few people raised hands in quiet farewell when they thought elders weren't watching.

She raised her own hand back.

Then she turned away.

They walked until the huts we're shadows, then dots, then gone.

When the sun reached high and the heat started to rise from the ground, Ksena stopped.

"I don't know where to put this feeling," she said.

"What feeling?"

"Like I don't belong in either world now."

Alcuin shifted his pack and stared out across the empty plains.

"Then we make a third one," he said.

Ksena did not answer.

Behind them, the village returned to routine as if nothing had changed, because routine was how people survived fear.

Ahead of them, the world opened wide and indifferent.

By dusk, they would camp under open sky with no walls, no council, and no path back.
