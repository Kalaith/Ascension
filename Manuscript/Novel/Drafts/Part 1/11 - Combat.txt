Alcuin cursed himself for being stupid, he had unwisely let them get surrounded, he should protect her and instead a pack of wolfs has encircled them, what could he do, he could keep them busy for a while, but it would only last so long before they got overwhelmed, the wolfs we're clever pack hunters, and the heavy pace had taken a toll on Ksena already
Ksena what was she doing, Alcuin watched as she went from terrified and huddling to running,
"Where are you going don't run away I'll protect you!" Ksena kept running and Aluin cursed and chased after her, her fright would get them both killed at this rate, it didn't take Alcuin long to catch up to her, or the wolves to tighten the surrounding circle,
"stop why are you running, we need to stand and fight"
"Its close over here, something is calling me I know it!"
"Ksena, have you lost your senses? We are. Surrounded, the wolves are coming at us on all sides and I've already dropped my pack to chase after you, which we might have been able to build a fire to scare them off!"
Ksena nodded but didn't reply, her breath coming heavy. She was not used to running this far, but something she sensed was calling her and she was nearly there. It wouldn't be long now, they just had to reach it.
She didn't even realize she reached it when the ground suddenly was not under her foot and she stumbled forward, down into a cave that was party obscured, Alcuin saw her fall but he was running too fast to stop himself and was soon stumbling down after her, the howls of wolfs growing louder, just great he thought, I bet she has sent us down into the wolf's den to be there dinner
But after getting back to his feet, recovering quicker than Ksena, who was still sprawled on the ground, this wasn't a cave, it was a structure. They stood before a door; the door was sealed and with no obvious way of opening it,
"Ksena stand up and try to get that door open. I'll hold the wolves off!"
Ksena peered up at the door, the door looked like a normal door from her city, other than it looks allot older, using the wall to help herself up, Ksena ran her fingers over the door, the door didn't look active, but it lit up as her fingers traced the opening signal, and the door with a sluggish movement, it hadn't been open for a while, Ksena didn't even try to look what was inside it before going in, Alcuin heard the door open before him, the wolfs still hadn't come down, so he backed until he was behind the door that has slammed fully open
"Okay, close to it quickly they are right up outside of this cave", Ksena quickly leaned forward and triggered the close action on the door, it closed as the first wolf came prowling down the stairs, Alcuin through a rock at it to stop it from lunging at them, and giving the door time to shut, once it shut it was stone silent they couldn't hear the confused wolf on the other side, and it was completely pitch black.
After they escaped the wolves and the ruin doors sealed behind them, Ksena and Alcuin sat in the dark until their breathing slowed. Alcuin could hear claws scraping stone outside, then circling, then fading.

"Will they come back?" Ksena whispered.

"Yes," Alcuin said. "But not through that door quickly."

He found a wall panel and managed to force dim emergency light. The corridor stretched farther than expected, with three side alcoves and one larger chamber.

"We rest here until they lose interest," he said.

Ksena nodded and wrapped her arms around herself. "I froze when they closed in. Then I heard... something."

"Calling you?"

"Yes."

He frowned but did not mock her this time. "That call got us under stone and alive."

They moved deeper into the chamber and found a raised platform where they could sit above floor dust. Alcuin checked entry points, then finally allowed himself to inspect his own arm, where a wolf had raked shallow claws during the chase.

Ksena saw the blood and immediately shifted closer.

"Let me see."

"It's nothing."

"That's not an answer."

She cleaned the scratches with water and tore a strip from her spare cloth to wrap them.

Alcuin watched her hands, surprised by how steady they were now compared to the panic outside.

"You did we'll," he said.

"I ran us into a hole."

"You ran us out of a kill ring."

That mattered.

When they had enough light to move, Alcuin retrieved a dropped spear from near the entry and tested corridor stability with careful taps. They found a side room containing old storage crates fused shut by time and heat.

"War site," he guessed.

"Or shelter," Ksena said.

"Both maybe."

By evening the howls outside had stopped. They waited another hour anyway.

"We go out together," Alcuin said. "Fast. Grab packs. Back in if they rush."

Ksena repeated the plan aloud until both of them could do it without thinking.

At dusk they opened the outer door a hand's width first and listened.

Nothing.

They stepped out carefully. The wolves we're gone, but paw marks circled the entrance in deep loops. Their packs lay torn where Alcuin had dropped them, one strap shredded, dried meat partly scattered.

"Great," Alcuin muttered. "Dinner voted against us."

They salvaged what they could and moved away from the cave before full dark.

"No fire for the first hour," Alcuin said. "If the pack is nearby they track by light and smell."

They walked in moonlight through shallow gullies until they reached a windbreak of split rocks. There they lit a small, shielded flame.

Alcuin finally allowed himself to sit.

"I was wrong," he said.

Ksena blinked. "About what?"

"I thought your panic would get us both killed."

"It almost did."

"No. Panic runs in circles. You ran toward something."

She stared into the coals. "I don't know what it was."

"Then we find out."

The next morning brought fresh tracks, not wolves this time but larger hoofed animals passing north. Alcuin used that sign to choose a route with fewer predator marks.

By noon they reached low scrub where hunting was possible. Alcuin set two snares while Ksena gathered dry thorn branches for fire and marked a simple perimeter line the way he had shown her.

"Like this?" she asked.

"Closer spacing," he said. "If something crosses, we want sound."

She redid it without complaint.

By late afternoon one snare held a small hare. Not much, but enough.

They ate and reviewed the map imagery from the ruin in memory, arguing over landmark shapes and likely distances.

"You keep assuming straight travel," Alcuin said. "The land never cooperates."

"You keep assuming every unknown thing is danger."

"Out here, that's usually right."

She sighed, then nodded. "Fine. Cautious route."

He raised his water skin in mock salute. "Now you're learning."

That night, a distant howl carried from the west, farther than before.

Ksena tightened her blanket but did not panic.

"They're hunting elsewhere," Alcuin said.

"Good."

"You still scared?"

"Yes."

"Good."

She gave him an offended look. "You keep saying that."

"Because scared people pay attention."

On the third day after the wolf attack, they reached a ridge where the plains opened and the ruined line of ancient sites became visible in the distance, little teeth of stone breaking the horizon.

Ksena stood still for a long time.

"That's where we go," she said.

"Yeah."

"Even after all this?"

"Especially after all this," Alcuin replied.

The wolves had nearly killed them.

The city had exiled them.

The world had not become kinder.

But as they descended the ridge side by side, carrying patched packs and shared caution, they were no longer just survivors of one bad night.

they were becoming partners in something larger than either had chosen.

And that made the danger feel, if not smaller, at least worth facing.

On the fourth night after the wolf encounter, they heard distant howls again but neither of them froze. Alcuin checked wind, adjusted fire height, and handed Ksena first watch without argument. She took it and held the perimeter until dawn, tired but steady.

"You're improving," he said when she woke him.

"I prefer not dying," she answered.

"Good priority."

By sunrise they packed in practiced silence, and Alcuin noticed Ksena checking trap lines before he asked.

The wolves kept their distance that day, but the lesson stayed close.

They were alive because luck had not finished with them yet, not because they were ready.

By dark, both of them understood the same thing: the road ahead would not get kinder.
