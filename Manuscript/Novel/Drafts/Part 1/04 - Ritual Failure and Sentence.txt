Council judgment came before sunset.

No public hearing.

No witness statements.

No chance to question ritual logs.

Ksena was brought to lower tribunal chamber in restraint cords and made to stand in center ring while elders spoke around her as if she were an object under assessment, not a person who had grown up three corridors from their doors.

"Candidate displayed resistance under alignment pressure," one elder said.

"Potential contamination through unsanctioned outside contact," said another.

"Protocol breach risk to control lattice stability," said a third.

Ksena looked for her father and found him among them, expression closed, flame still.

"I did not attack anyone," she said.

No one acknowledged the sentence.

The First Elder raised one hand and delivered terms.

"By council vote, candidate Ksena is removed from city residency under mercy doctrine and reassigned to external status pending future review."

Mercy doctrine.

A clean phrase for exile and surveillance without bars.

Ksena felt the room tilt.

"External where?" she asked.

No answer.

"For how long?"

No answer.

Her father finally spoke, voice formal.

"The order is final. External placement will expose outside contamination routes. We observe, we map, we contain."

She stared at him.

"Say that like my father, not your title."

His jaw flexed once.

He did not repeat himself.

Guards moved her out before she could say anything else worth punishing.

In lower passage, Kalani waited beside a pillar with hands clenched hard enough that flame flickered at her fingertips.

"I didn't vote," Kalani said too quickly.

"Could you have changed it?"

Kalani looked away.

"No."

"Then why are you here?"

Kalani swallowed.

"To tell you this wasn't random. They are afraid of what happened in the hall."

Ksena stepped closer.

"What happened in the hall?"

Kalani shook her head once.

"I don't know. I only know they are calling it resistance."

Footsteps sounded from upper stair. Kalani's posture reset in an instant.

"Go," she said in ritual tone, as if giving an order to a stranger.

Ksena laughed once without humor.

"You already did."

She was escorted to her room under guard and given one hour to pack.

One hour to choose what remained of a life.

She took two sets of clothes, water flask, field blanket, small knife she had never needed inside city walls, and Alcuin's carved bird.

She left everything else.

At gate checkpoint, she expected to see her mother.

She did not.

She expected to see her father.

She did not.

Kalani stood alone at final barrier lock, eyes bright with heat and something like panic.

"They'll monitor first route segment," she said under her breath while entering release code. "Do not run until second marker."

"You're helping me now?"

"I'm helping myself live with this," Kalani said.

Barrier light opened.

Outside waited two city guards, six village representatives, and Alcuin in restraint ties.

Ksena froze.

"Why is he bound?"

The village elder answered, not looking at her.

"Council demanded one companion assignment from our side. Said your outside contact influenced ritual outcome. If we refused, they would classify Alcuin as a resistance link and burn two border villages as example."

Alcuin lifted his hands slightly, cords cutting into wrists.

"Congratulations," he said to Ksena. "You got me exiled too."

No one laughed.

The elder finally looked at Ksena.

"Do not mistake this for betrayal," he said quietly. "We chose the path that left our people standing."

Boundary protocol was read. Compliance signatures logged. Restraints removed only after city guards withdrew behind barrier.

When light wall sealed again, sound changed.

No more city hum.

Only wind.

Ksena stood with pack at her feet and nowhere to go.

Alcuin rubbed his wrists and stared at the closed barrier like he might break it open by anger alone.

"This was not your plan," he said.

"No."

"Mine either."

Village elder handed them one travel bundle.

Water. Dried meat. Basic field cord.

No promises.

"You leave our lands by dawn," he said. "If patrol asks, we complied exactly."

Ksena nodded, throat tight.

As the village party turned back, she called after them.

"Tell my mother..."

Words failed.

No one turned.

Alcuin picked up the bundle and started walking west along boundary stones.

"If we stop now, we'll freeze before dark," he said.

Ksena lifted her pack and followed.

Behind them, the barrier glowed steady and indifferent.

Ahead, plains widened into evening and danger.

Exile had lasted less than one hour and already cost both of them everything they knew.
