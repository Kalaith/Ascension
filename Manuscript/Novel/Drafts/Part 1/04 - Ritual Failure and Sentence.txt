Council judgment came before sunset.

No public hearing.

No witness statements.

No chance to question ritual logs.

Ksena was brought to lower tribunal chamber in restraint cords and made to stand inside center ring while elders spoke around her as if she were an object under assessment, not a person who had grown up three corridors from their doors.

"Candidate displayed resistance under alignment pressure," one elder said.

"Potential contamination through unsanctioned outside contact," said another.

"Protocol breach risk to control lattice stability," said a third.

Ksena looked for her father and found him among them, expression closed, flame still.

"I did not attack anyone," she said.

No one acknowledged the sentence.

The First Elder raised one hand.

"By council vote, candidate Ksena is removed from city residency under mercy doctrine and reassigned to external status pending future review."

Mercy doctrine.

A clean phrase for exile and surveillance without bars.

The room tilted. Ksena kept her knees locked anyway.

"External where?" she asked.

No answer.

"For how long?"

No answer.

Her father finally spoke, voice formal enough to cut.

"The order is final. External placement will expose outside contamination routes. We observe, we map, we contain."

She stared at him.

"Say that like my father, not your title."

His jaw flexed once.

He did not repeat himself.

Guards moved her out before she could say anything else worth punishing.

In lower passage, Kalani waited beside a pillar, hands clenched hard enough flame flickered at her fingertips.

"I didn't vote," Kalani said too quickly.

"Could you have changed it?"

"No."

"Then why are you here?"

Kalani looked away.

"To tell you this wasn't random. They are afraid of what happened in the hall."

Ksena stepped closer.

"What happened in the hall?"

"I don't know. I only know they are calling it resistance."

"And you believe them?"

Kalani's answer took too long.

"I believe fear makes people cruel in procedural language," she said quietly.

Footsteps echoed from upper stair. Kalani's posture reset in an instant.

"Go," she said in ritual tone, as if ordering a stranger.

Ksena laughed once without humor.

"You already did."

She was escorted to her room and given one hour to pack.

One hour to choose what remained of a life.

She took two sets of clothes, one field blanket, one water flask, a small knife she had never needed inside city walls, needle and thread, and Alcuin's carved bird.

She left everything else.

Halfway through packing, her oldest sister appeared in the doorway without entering.

"I requested reconsideration," the sister said.

Ksena almost laughed.

"And?"

"Denied."

"Did you expect otherwise?"

The sister did not answer. Her gaze moved once to the packed field blanket, then to Ksena's hands.

"Outside is not manageable by city rhythm," she said. "Do not think discipline replaces weather."

"Is that advice or farewell?"

"Both," the sister said, then left before guards could question why she had come.

At gate checkpoint, Ksena expected to see her mother.

She did not.

She expected to see her father.

She did not.

Kalani stood alone at final barrier lock, eyes bright with heat and something like panic.

"They'll monitor first route segment," she said under her breath while entering release code. "Do not run until second marker."

"You're helping me now?"

"I'm helping myself live with this," Kalani said.

Barrier light opened.

Outside waited two city guards, six village representatives, and Alcuin in restraint ties.

Ksena froze.

"Why is he bound?"

The village elder answered without meeting her eyes.

"Council demanded one companion assignment from our side. They said your outside contact influenced ritual outcome. If we refused, they would classify Alcuin as a resistance link and burn two border villages as example."

Alcuin lifted his hands slightly. Cords bit deep into his wrists.

"Congratulations," he said to Ksena. "You got me exiled too."

No one laughed.

The elder finally looked up.

"Do not mistake this for betrayal," he said quietly. "We chose the path that left our people standing."

Boundary protocol was read in full. Compliance signatures logged. Restraints removed only after city guards withdrew behind barrier.

When light wall sealed again, sound changed.

No more city hum.

Only wind.

Ksena stood with pack at her feet and nowhere to go.

Alcuin rubbed raw wrists and stared at the closed barrier like he might break it open by anger alone.

"This was not your plan," he said.

"No."

"Mine either."

Village delegation handed them one travel bundle.

Water.

Dried meat.

Basic field cord.

No promises.

"You leave our lands by dawn," the elder said. "If patrol asks, we complied exactly."

Ksena nodded, throat tight.

As the village party turned back, she called after them.

"Tell my mother..."

Words failed.

No one turned.

Alcuin picked up the bundle and started west along boundary stones.

"If we stop now, we'll freeze before dark," he said.

Ksena shouldered her pack and followed.

They reached first ridge cut in silence except for boots on grit. Dusk fell fast. Alcuin checked horizon, found no immediate patrol lights, and dropped to one knee beside a weathered marker post.

"Two routes," he said, tracing lines in dust. "North line has better water but higher visibility. West line has bad water and more cover."

"They'll watch north."

"Agreed. West, then."

She looked back once. Barrier glowed red through evening haze, steady and indifferent.

"Do you think they'll actually burn villages?" she asked.

Alcuin did not soften his answer.

"If your father believes fear keeps structure stable, yes."

She hated how easy it was to believe him.

They moved until dark made footing dangerous, then stopped in a shallow stone hollow and built the smallest fire possible.

No one ate much.

No one slept much.

Near midnight, distant bells carried faint across plains from inside city walls, marking curfew for people who still had one.

Ksena stared into coals and tried to fit one fact against another.

Her family had not executed her.

Her family had weaponized her.

Morning would make that strategy stronger unless she survived long enough to break it.

Before first light, Alcuin woke her with one word.

"Move."

She rose, stamped out embers, and adjusted the carved bird hidden in her sleeve.

Exile had lasted less than one hour and already cost both of them everything they knew.

Now it demanded something harder.

Learning how to stay alive in a world her city had called wild so long it forgot the wild could answer back.

They cleared second marker just before full dark and stopped in a low cut where wind would mask small sound.

Alcuin unpacked travel bundle and split contents without comment.

Three strips meat.

Two hard bread rounds.

One packet dried herbs.

Two small salt chips.

"That's not random," Ksena said.

"No," Alcuin answered. "Someone in that village knew exactly how long two people can move before poor ration math starts killing decision quality."

She looked back toward the ridge where delegation had vanished.

"Why didn't they just refuse?"

"Because refusal gets children buried," he said. "You saw the elder's face. He wasn't negotiating. He was preserving what could still be preserved."

She hated that answer because it left no one clean.

After they ate, Alcuin checked her restraint bruises and shoulder mobility with brisk practicality.

"Raise your arm."

She did and hissed.

"Pain?"

"Yes."

"Instability?"

"No."

"Good. We can work with pain."

"Comforting."

"I am a comforting person."

That almost made her laugh.

Almost.

Near midnight, a faint red flash pulsed once on eastern horizon.

Signal flare.

Alcuin's face hardened.

"They already pushed route confirmation back to city lines."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning your father started the tracking game before we finished our first meal."

Ksena sat very still.

"Then we stop being predictable now."

He nodded.

"Good."

They changed their plan before sleep:

- no direct west line at dawn,
- no repeated pace rhythm,
- no fire second night,
- all route choices made at last possible moment.

When first gray hit the stones, Ksena stood, tightened her pack, and looked once more toward barrier glow fading in distance.

"Whatever they think this exile does for them," she said, "it ends the day I stop being usable."

Alcuin adjusted spear strap and started walking.

"Then let's get to work."

They walked into first light without speaking.

Behind them was sentence.

Ahead was weather, hunger, pursuit, and uncertainty.

Ksena preferred uncertainty.

At least uncertainty had not yet decided who she was.

She did not look back again.

Not because the city no longer mattered.

Because the work ahead required facing the direction of danger, not the direction of loss.

Behind them, protocol had spoken.

Ahead, consequence would answer.

She set her jaw and matched Alcuin's pace.

No hesitation left to spend.

One step. Then another.

That was enough for now.

They kept their eyes forward and their pace honest.

Survival, now, was the only argument that mattered.

Neither did he.

Still.
