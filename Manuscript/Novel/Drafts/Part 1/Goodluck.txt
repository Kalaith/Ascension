everywhere Ksena went today, she was wished for good luck; the city had little children in it, beside herself there was 2 others going through the ritual today, the ritual was held one per year for everyone that had come of age since the last ritual, this year was special in that 3 attendees, there was no ritual last year, no one was coming of age, the year beforehand her sister was the only one to do the ritual, the ritual was for both males and females, although there was only a small group of male ascendant, females where born more often and the population was female dominated, however the council of elders was predominantly male, it also meant things like marriage was not common, her parents being married was a rare exception, her mother served in the army that guarded the village, her father was one elder, the elders made all the rules and decisions, if Ksena was to have children in the future the elders would be the one to say so and they would also choose the father, Ksena would love a child, maybe a girl or two, but this wasn’t a decision coming up soon, she would first have to prove herself in the army, only the strongest where given permission to have children.
Since the other ritual attendees this year was around the same age as Ksena, she had grown up and played with them, only her involvement with the tribe outside stopped them from being a close as friends as she would have liked, especially since after her sister become ascendant and spent less time with her and none visiting the tribe, she had defiantly changed during the ritual; she was more aloof than before and very fixated on being the best among the ascendant. Ksena had asked if she wanted children. The look her sister gave her clarified that was a no.
The two other girls would visit around the city as well, they stuck together more, but neither had a sister like Ksena, which might have been why there was some distance between them, but Ksena was happy to be with her thoughts, and once they all became ascended, those walls would lessen they would be like sisters, Ksena wondered if her own relationship with her sister would be renewed when they could both do ascended activities together
