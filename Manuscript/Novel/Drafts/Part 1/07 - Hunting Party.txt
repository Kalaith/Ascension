At first light they left the overlook above the burned settlement and cut west to avoid whatever had done it.

Before noon they found first sign of inhabited territory: a trapline marker cut into deadwood, fresh and high enough to warn outsiders.

Alcuin saw it first and swore under his breath.

"Not ours," he said. "Stay close. Let me talk."

Ksena tightened grip on spear and nodded.

The encounter came twenty minutes later in a dry creek channel.

Three youths stepped from scrub with bows half-drawn and confidence full-grown. Their leader had a scar across his cheek and the smile of someone used to winning by intimidation.

"You crossed hunting boundary," he said. "Fee for passage."

Alcuin kept tone level.

"We're not taking game. Just passing west."

One youth pointed at Ksena.

"Ascendant."

Leader's smile sharpened.

"Fee just doubled."

Ksena felt old city instinct rise: straighten posture, deny fear, command room. Out here it would get her killed.

She stayed behind Alcuin.

"We don't want trouble," Alcuin said.

"You brought trouble with you," leader answered.

His eyes moved over Ksena's bandaged arm and sleeved token seam as if inventorying weaknesses.

"Leave the girl and go."

Alcuin's shoulders locked.

"No."

Leader reached for spear.

"Then we take both."

Alcuin moved first, driving shoulder into leader's chest before the other two could coordinate. The strike knocked him backward into gravel. One youth lunged with spear thrust. Alcuin parried and spun, using shaft leverage to disarm without full break.

Second youth rushed Ksena.

She stumbled back, raised spear too high, and barely blocked a downward strike that jarred both wrists.

"Ksena, left!" Alcuin shouted.

She moved left on instinct. The youth overcommitted and slipped. Ksena struck with spear butt, catching his jaw. Not clean, but enough to open distance.

Leader regained feet with blood on lip and fury in his eyes.

"Hold her!" he yelled.

Alcuin dropped one attacker with elbow strike and pivoted toward Ksena. A spear point clipped his thigh before he could clear line.

He hissed, ignored pain, and slammed shaft across attacker's ribs.

The fight lasted less than a minute.

It felt longer.

When leader lunged again, Ksena stepped into range instead of retreating and cracked spear butt into his temple with both hands. He dropped hard.

Silence hit all at once.

The two remaining youths staggered backward, shocked by outcome as much as pain.

Alcuin pointed west with spear tip.

"Walk away. Now."

They hesitated, then dragged leader by shoulders into scrub and disappeared.

Ksena's breath shook.

"Did I just-"

"Yes," Alcuin said. "Move."

They ran for fifteen minutes before Alcuin's limp forced stop under lone cedar. Blood darkened his trouser leg.

"Sit," Ksena ordered.

He almost argued, saw her expression, and obeyed.

She cut fabric, cleaned wound, and wrapped pressure bandage with tighter hands than she expected.

"Deep?" she asked.

"Surface cut. Ugly, not fatal."

"Good. I don't have replacement hunters in my pack."

He laughed once despite pain.

"You're improving."

They should have moved immediately.

Instead voices reached them first.

A full hunting party crested ridge: ten adults in mixed formation, spears lowered but ready. At front walked an older woman with braided gray hair and the authority of someone who expected compliance without raising her voice.

"Weapons down," she said.

Alcuin lowered spear first. Ksena followed.

Older woman studied blood on Alcuin's leg, then Ksena's stance, then direction the youths had fled.

"My scouts caused this," she said. "You come to village."

"We can keep moving," Alcuin replied.

"You can," she said. "And bleed through your bandage before dusk."

That ended debate.

They walked with party to village three valleys west, larger than Ksena expected. Smoke rose from thirty-plus huts arranged around central fire ring. Children watched from doorways. Elders watched from benches with less curiosity and more calculation.

The three youths stood at center ring with heads lowered, leader sporting swelling bruise over left eye.

Older woman addressed gathered villagers.

"Boundary violation occurred both ways. Outsiders crossed without notice. Our youths initiated unlawful seizure attempt. This is resolved under hospitality code."

Murmurs rippled. No one challenged publicly.

Alcuin stepped forward despite limp.

"I apologize for injuries I caused in defense."

Leader looked like he wanted to spit.

Older woman's gaze cut him down first.

"You answer," she said.

Leader swallowed pride with effort.

"I apologize for our conduct. We offer treatment and one night shelter under code."

Alcuin nodded and clasped his forearm. Agreement sealed.

Ksena exhaled for what felt like first time in an hour.

A healer took Alcuin to treatment hut. Ksena expected to be separated and questioned immediately. Instead one of the hunt women handed her a water bowl and pointed to stool.

"Sit," the woman said. "You look like you'll fall over if you don't."

Ksena sat.

By evening, village tone shifted from alert to cautious normal. Fires lit. Stew pots set. Children resumed play within sight of armed adults. Hospitality did not equal trust. It only meant rules were functioning.

At shared meal, older woman introduced herself as Head Hunter Varen.

"Where are you headed with ascendant?" Varen asked Alcuin.

"Ancient sites north and west," he said. "Research routes."

"Research isn't a wilderness profession."

"Neither is exile," Alcuin said.

Varen watched both of them for a long moment.

"Your city burned two villages last season under anti-smuggling claim," she said to Ksena. "You understand why my youths see ascendant and think weapon first?"

Ksena forced herself not to look away.

"I do now."

"Good."

After meal, Varen took them aside behind storage racks where sound would not carry easily.

"The three who attacked you are fools," she said. "But fools hear what elders whisper. Rumor says city command is pushing outer-route watch teams harder than usual. Looking for two young exiles and one tribal male contact."

Alcuin's jaw tightened.

"How wide is the search?"

"Wider than your current pace outruns."

She handed him a folded strip of cured hide with coded marks.

"Three safe water points. One no-fire camp notch. Use once and move."

Ksena accepted with both hands.

"Why help us?"

Varen's expression stayed hard.

"Because your father treats all border villages as replaceable," she said. "Any route that complicates his certainty has value."

That night, Ksena and Alcuin slept in separate guest alcoves under watch rotation. Before dawn, Maera-like tension returned in the form of the youth leader appearing outside their alcove with a wrapped parcel.

"Dried meat," he muttered without meeting Ksena's eyes. "For road."

"Thank you," Ksena said.

He nodded once and left.

When they set out after first light, Varen walked them to boundary stone.

"One warning," she said. "Your next marker line crosses old shrine basin. Scouts report wolf movement and one unidentified fire-signature event there last week."

Ksena exchanged glance with Alcuin.

"We'll adjust."

"Do."

They left village under low cloud and moved into broken scrub country.

By midday Alcuin's limp worsened. They stopped in shade cut while Ksena re-wrapped his thigh bandage.

"Too tight?" she asked.

"No. Just angry tissue."

"You're sure?"

"Ksena."

"Right."

She sat back, frustrated with her own uncertainty.

"I swung at him because I was scared," she said quietly.

"Good," Alcuin said.

"Good?"

"Fear kept you alive long enough to act. That's the point. Panic freezes. Fear can still move."

She considered that while tying final knot.

Late afternoon brought wind shift and another howl from far west. They made camp early on rock shelf with one narrow approach and one escape line.

Over small shielded fire, Alcuin unrolled Varen's coded strip and overlayed it with Ksena's temple marks.

"If we take this bend, we can hit shrine basin and still clear to your hidden line before fourth day," he said.

"Do we trust the warning?"

"We trust that she gains nothing by lying that specifically."

Ksena nodded.

Before sleep she wrote brief log entry on field slate:

- Contact: hostile youths, formal hunting party, negotiated code.
- Outcome: survived, treated, gained route intelligence.
- Risk: search net widening.

Underlined once: trust remains conditional everywhere.

At dawn they broke camp and moved toward shrine basin.

A sealed stone door waited there, half-buried under dust and thorn, exactly where Varen's route mark and Ksena's ritual memory intersected.

Ksena stared at carved panel and felt that now-familiar pulse at base of wrist.

"This is from the ritual images," she whispered.

Behind them, wind shifted and carried another wolf call.

Closer this time.

Alcuin looked from panel to open plain.

"Whatever this is," he said, "it might be our only shelter."

Ksena stepped forward and laid her hand on the panel.

The door answered.

As they followed the opening seam into darkness, Alcuin spoke without turning.

"Same rule as always. If one of us says stop-"

"-we stop," Ksena finished.

He nodded once.

"Good."

For the first time since exile, the words felt automatic.

Not because danger had lessened.

Because they had started becoming a unit that could survive danger without discussing every step.
