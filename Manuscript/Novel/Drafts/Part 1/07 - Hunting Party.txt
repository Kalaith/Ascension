At first light they left the overlook above the burned settlement and cut west to avoid whatever had done it.

Before noon they found the first sign of another village: a trapline marker cut into deadwood, fresh and high enough to warn outsiders.

Alcuin saw it first and swore under his breath.

"Not ours," he said. "Stay close and let me talk."

Ksena tightened her grip on the spear and nodded.

The encounter happened twenty minutes later in a dry creek channel.

Three young hunters stepped out from scrub with bows half-drawn and confidence full-grown. Their leader had a scar across his cheek and the kind of grin that looked for weakness first.

"You crossed hunting boundary," he said. "Fee for passage."

Alcuin kept his tone neutral.

"We're not taking your game. Just passing west."

One of the others pointed at Ksena.

"Ascendant."

The leader's grin sharpened.

"Then fee just doubled."

Ksena felt the old city instinct rise in her: straighten posture, deny fear, command the room. Out here it would get her killed.

She stayed behind Alcuin.

"We don't want trouble," Alcuin said.

"You brought trouble with you," the leader answered.

He stepped in closer.

"Leave your pack and go. Leave the girl too."

Alcuin moved before he finished speaking, shoving him back and opening space.

Everything broke at once.

One bow snapped up.

Alcuin knocked it wide with his forearm.

The second hunter rushed with a short spear.

Ksena thrust on instinct and missed high, but the motion bought Alcuin half a second to pivot and disarm him.

The leader recovered and swung at Alcuin's jaw. Alcuin took the hit, answered with shoulder drive, and sent him into creek gravel.

"Run!" Alcuin shouted to Ksena.

She did.

He followed three steps behind while the hunters cursed and regrouped.

No arrows came. Maybe they did not want blood feud. Maybe they thought distance would hand the work to weather and predators.

By dusk, Ksena and Alcuin reached a ridge of broken basalt and dropped into shadow to catch breath.

Alcuin pressed fingers to split lip and winced.

"You all right?" Ksena asked.

"I've had better afternoons."

She sat beside him and stared at her shaking hands.

"I almost froze again."

"You didn't," he said. "You moved when it mattered."

She looked at him.

"They wanted me. Not the pack."

"Yes."

"Because of what I am?"

Alcuin spat blood into dust.

"Because of what people think your kind took from theirs."

Night wind came colder than expected.

They made camp in a narrow stone fold with no fire, no light, and no conversation above whisper.

Near midnight, distant howls rolled across the plain.

Alcuin did not sleep.

At dawn he checked horizon and made a decision.

"No more open routes," he said. "We cut through old ruin belt. Dangerous, but less traffic."

Ksena touched the carved bird hidden in her sleeve and stood.

"Let's go."

By afternoon they reached a low rise where ground had collapsed into a half-hidden entry cut.

Stone framing. Old glyphs under dust.

A sealed door.

Ksena stared.

"This is from the ritual images," she whispered.

Behind them, wind shifted and carried another wolf call.

Closer this time.

Alcuin looked at the door, then at the open plain.

"Whatever this is," he said, "it might be our only shelter."

Ksena stepped toward the panel.

The door answered her touch.
