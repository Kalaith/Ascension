By the third day outside, exile stopped feeling like a shock and started feeling like logistics.

Water first.

Heat second.

Predators third.

Everything else after that.

Ksena's shoulders ached from pack weight and from sleeping wrong on stone. Alcuin's right hand stayed near his spear even while walking. Neither said much unless it mattered.

When they did speak, it was about route and risk.

"Ridge line or valley floor?"

"Ridge. Better visibility."

"Food tonight?"

"If luck holds."

Luck did not hold.

By late afternoon, clouds rolled in hard from the north and turned open plains into wind corridor. Dust cut visibility. Temperature dropped fast.

They found shelter in a half-collapsed stone structure that might once have been a waystation and might once have been something older.

Alcuin secured the doorway with broken timber and set a smoke-thin fire in center pit.

Ksena held both hands over the flame and felt useless.

"I slowed us down again," she said.

Alcuin did not look up.

"You stayed moving. That's enough today."

"That's not a compliment."

"No," he said. "It's survival math."

Rain hit the roof in hard bursts. Somewhere outside, metal scraped stone in irregular intervals, too heavy for branch movement and too rhythmically wrong for animal claw.

Ksena went still.

"Did you hear that?"

"Yes."

Alcuin killed the fire with one sweep and motioned her low.

Dark closed around them.

Scrape.

Pause.

Scrape.

Then silence.

It lasted long enough to hurt.

When sound returned, it came from farther downslope, followed by a low vibration that moved through the floor like distant machinery.

Neither of them slept much.

At dawn they found tracks in wet mud outside the shelter.

Not wolf.

Not any village animal Ksena recognized.

Three-toed impressions with deep heel pressure and drag marks as if something heavy had been carried or damaged.

Alcuin crouched over the print and swore under his breath.

"This isn't local fauna," he said.

Ksena remembered the crystal images she had seen in ritual hall. Unknown armored shapes. Fire in the sky.

"I saw tracks like this in the visions," she said quietly.

Alcuin stood.

"Then your visions are not memory. They're warning."

They followed the trail only long enough to confirm direction. It led east, toward old city corridors both of them had planned to avoid.

Halfway through morning they crested a ridge and saw smoke columns in the distance.

Too straight for brush fire.

Too dark for camp cooking.

Deliberate burn.

Ksena stared, pulse rising.

"Village?"

"Maybe," Alcuin said. "Maybe supply camp. Either way we don't walk blind into it."

He dropped to one knee and pulled their map strip flat on stone.

"We take the long arc south, hit old route markers, and approach from high ground at dusk."

Ksena nodded, then hesitated.

"If it's my people..."

Alcuin met her eyes.

"Then we learn before we act."

They moved in silence for the next hours, circling wide through cut ravines and sparse grass breaks where tracks were harder to read from distance.

By late day they reached a narrow overlook above a ruined settlement.

Charred timber.

Collapsed roofs.

No movement.

No survivors visible.

Ksena pressed a fist to her mouth and looked away.

Alcuin scanned perimeter for signs of recent patrol. "Fire pattern is controlled," he said. "Not storm, not accident."

"Could have been raiders."

"Could," he said. "Could also be ascendant strike." 

The words stayed between them like another weather front.

They did not descend before dark.

They made hidden camp instead, cold and silent, with no fire and no conversation beyond whisper range.

As night settled, Ksena held Alcuin's carved bird inside her sleeve and listened to distant thunder she could not tell from engines in memory.

Exile had begun as punishment.

Now it was becoming evidence.

Whatever the city had feared in her ritual was already moving across the world outside the barrier.

And she was standing in its path with one hunter, one dull spear, and no home to return to.
