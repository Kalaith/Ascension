By the third day outside, exile stopped feeling like shock and started feeling like logistics.

Water first.

Heat second.

Predators third.

Everything else after that.

Ksena's shoulders ached from pack weight and bad sleep on stone. Alcuin's right hand stayed near spear even while walking. Neither spoke much unless it mattered.

When they did speak, it was route and risk.

"Ridge line or valley floor?"

"Ridge. Better visibility."

"Food tonight?"

"If luck holds."

Luck did not hold.

Near midday, clouds banked over north horizon and pushed fast. Wind rose through cut valleys, carrying grit hard enough to sting exposed skin. Visibility dropped. Temperature followed.

They found shelter in a collapsed relay house half-buried in shale. One wall remained intact enough to block wind. Alcuin braced opening with broken planks and set a low fire in center pit.

Ksena checked stores while he secured perimeter.

"Two full flasks, one half," she reported. "Dried meat for two days if we ration, three if we hate ourselves."

"Good. We hate ourselves."

She almost smiled.

He dropped beside fire, wiped dust from his mouth, and pointed at map cloth.

"Show me exactly where the carved marker was."

Ksena marked it with charcoal.

"Here. The symbol matched what I saw during ritual feedback."

"You keep calling them images," Alcuin said. "Could be memory bleed, not map."

"Could be. But if it's random, why did we find the symbol where your old tracks don't show route use?"

He had no answer for that.

Rain came hard by late afternoon, hammering broken roof stone. They shifted deeper into shelter and sat with knees almost touching, both too tired to maintain distance for pride.

After a long stretch, Ksena asked what she had been avoiding.

"If we survive this," she said, "what then?"

"Then we survive the next week."

"That's not a plan."

"It is when one bad decision kills us before sunrise."

She leaned back against wall and closed eyes.

"I used to think knowing enough made you safe."

"Outside, knowing enough keeps you less dead," Alcuin said. "Not safe."

Night settled early under storm cloud.

On first watch, Alcuin shook Ksena awake and pointed to far ridge. Through rain she saw three faint heat points moving in triangular spread.

Too regular for wildlife.

Too steady for hunters in weather this bad.

"Patrol?" she whispered.

"Maybe. Maybe scouts. Either way, not friends."

They banked fire to embers and waited without speaking until heat points faded west.

In morning, storm had passed but tracks remained in mud near southern approach.

Boots.

Three people.

Spacing disciplined.

Alcuin crouched and touched edge of print.

"Fresh. Less than six hours."

"Following us?"

"Not directly. But crossing near enough to matter."

They moved out immediately.

By noon, terrain changed from open shelf to broken gullies and thorn scrub where line-of-sight collapsed into short windows. Ksena tripped twice on hidden roots. The second fall tore skin across her forearm.

She swore, sat hard on a stone, and held arm while blood welled.

Alcuin knelt.

"Show me."

"It's fine."

"Show me."

She did.

He cleaned cut with sparing water, wrapped it, and checked bandage tension twice.

"No deep tear," he said. "You'll keep full grip."

She flexed fingers.

"Useful. I still can't throw straight."

"We'll fix that."

Afternoon brought the first sign they were near old temple line: a collapsed pillar carved with repeating spiral glyphs partly hidden by moss and dust.

Ksena touched stone and felt the same wrist-prickle as at previous marker.

"Again," she said.

"You feeling anything besides creepy symbolism?"

"Direction. Faint."

"Direction where?"

She pointed northeast.

"That way."

He squinted at slope.

"That way is bad footing, limited water, and perfect ambush terrain."

"And maybe answers."

"Answers don't help if we bleed out finding them."

They argued in low voices for ten minutes.

Not because either wanted to win.

Because both were right in different ways.

Compromise came ugly.

Follow northeast for two hours maximum.

Abort if no confirming sign.

No open ridge crossings.

No flame output unless lethal threat.

They moved.

An hour in, they found nothing.

At one hour forty, they found a rusted access hatch half-buried in brush with the same spiral glyph cut into frame.

Alcuin exhaled once.

"Fine. You were right."

"Say it louder so the hill hears."

"No."

Hatch was sealed beyond brute force. Ksena ran fingers along edge seams and found a recessed plate under grime.

It did not open.

She tried the opening stroke she had used at hidden station.

Plate lit weak amber and failed.

"Dead system," Alcuin said.

"Maybe dormant."

She adjusted pressure, repeated stroke slower, and added second symbol from memory.

A click answered.

Not full unlock.

Partial.

Hatch lifted three centimeters and stopped.

Alcuin wedged spear shaft under edge and both forced it open enough to look inside.

Dark shaft descended into stale air.

No immediate movement. No sound.

"We are not going down now," Alcuin said.

Ksena hated agreeing.

"No. We mark it and come back with light and strength."

She carved route mark on nearby stone and wrapped it in code only she and Alcuin would recognize.

Dusk closed fast. They made camp in narrow slot canyon with one entrance and one fallback scramble route. Alcuin set thornline alarms. Ksena cooked thin stew from last root strips and a handful of grain.

When they ate, he watched her hold spoon too carefully with bandaged arm.

"Hurts?"

"Everything hurts. That's different from injured."

"True."

Second watch, distant howls rose from west.

Not near.

Enough to remind.

Ksena held spear across knees and stared into dark until Alcuin relieved her at dawn.

"You can sleep another hour," he said.

"No. I don't want to lose movement window."

He gave her one of his rare approving looks.

"You are getting harder to keep alive," he said. "In a good way."

Day five opened clear and cold.

They climbed out of canyon and reached high shelf where plains rolled into broken teeth of old structures in the far distance.

Ksena stopped.

"There," she said.

Alcuin followed her line of sight.

"Could be ruin line. Could be rock."

"It's ruin."

They descended toward it by zigzag path to save knees and conserve water. Midway down, they found fresh ash in a small fire pit no more than a day old.

Three bedroll impressions.

One boot print matching patrol pattern from storm night.

"Same group," Alcuin said.

"Can we outrun them?"

"Not if they pick line and keep discipline. Better option is make ourselves hard to read."

He altered march pattern: double-backs through dry wash, stone crossings to break scent trail, decoy marks in opposite direction.

Ksena copied every move without question.

By sunset they reached low ridge with partial cover and line-of-sight to outlying structures.

No movement in ruins.

No lights.

No voices.

They camped cold, no fire.

Before sleep, Ksena opened field slate and wrote three headings:

Known.

Suspected.

Unverified.

Under known she wrote: system markers are real, legacy access still responds, external trackers active.

Under suspected: ritual images map historical infrastructure.

Under unverified: father command network already following exile routes.

Alcuin read over her shoulder.

"Good," he said. "Shock can't be the plan."

She closed slate and tucked it into oil wrap.

"Tomorrow we get close enough to confirm what's in those ruins," she said.

"Tomorrow we survive contact with whatever's already there," he answered.

Both meant the same thing.

Outside had stopped being unknown terrain.

It was now an active board.

And every move they made left evidence someone else could use.

They reached first visual of the outpost near nightfall but did not enter.

Alcuin insisted on one perimeter loop first.

"If we're watched, gate is where they wait," he said.

They circled from south ridge and counted four watch points, two hidden bow nests, one elevated signal mirror angled toward eastern patrol road.

Ksena memorized all of it.

"This place survives because it assumes betrayal," she said.

"Like your city."

"No," she said after a beat. "My city assumes obedience. This assumes negotiation under threat. Different kind of honesty."

They made cold camp half a kilometer out and agreed on entry protocol for dawn:

- Alcuin speaks first,
- Ksena observes lane behavior,
- no mention of ritual,
- no map exposure.

Before sleep, Ksena added one last line to slate.

Tomorrow we stop being only survivors and start being investigators.

She closed the cover and tucked it under her shoulder.

The outpost lights burned low on the horizon.

Close enough to promise help.

Close enough to promise new trouble.

Before moving, Alcuin pressed two fingers to the carved marker and then to his chest, old hunter gesture for remembered route.

Ksena copied the motion.

No ritual master taught her that.

It still felt like discipline.

They moved toward outpost smoke in disciplined silence, both aware that the next conversation might matter as much as the next fight.

Wilderness had taught one lesson fast: survival was social before it was heroic.
