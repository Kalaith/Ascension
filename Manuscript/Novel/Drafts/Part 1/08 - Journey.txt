Ksena stood facing Alcuin, why was Alcuin with her, she had been marched to this location, when she walked through the barrier it didn’t feel warm, it felt like her blood would freeze and the sun shining on her would never warm her up, in the direction they we're taking her stood one lone figure Alcuin, why was he here, once they arrived at the location the two ascendants guarding her said one word Leave before flying back to the city without even a second glance back at her.
Why are you here? Ksena asked.
Alcuin looked at her, her night must have been as rough as hers, he had never seen her look like this before; he wanted to reassure her, but she was also the reason he was here too, I was banished from my village, just like you
“You we're banished, why?”
“Since I did the ritual and they wanted to hold someone responsible, if I didn’t leave, your people would have destroyed the entire village and banished everyone.”
“No, it couldn’t be.” Ksena tried to see if Alcuin was not telling the truth, but his fast was steadfast, her eyes staring her down. She knew that she was at fault if only she had been ascended.
“What happened during the ritual?” Alcuin asked, “Why did it fail? How could it have been so bad you had me exiled from my home?”
Ksena took the hit, but she was exiled as we'll. Alcuin could find another tribe. She had nothing; she wasn’t even given supplies or a way to survive out here
“Your stupid ritual must have caused this! Instead of being filled with power, I just saw images until I thought my head would explode and instead of helping me understand what happened I was jailed and exiled by my mother and my sister did nothing to help!”
Alcuin took a step back, he had never seen Ksena lose her temper before, and her situation was worse than his, his tribe had made sure he was prepared for the trip, food and water and instructions for finding more basic shelter and directions, but Ksena just had the clothes she was wearing and nothing else, had her sister really stood by and did nothing or even try to help her, Alcuin couldn’t understand why she would do that
“Okay, let’s head towards a nearby tribe. I doubt they will let us stay, especially you once we are there and might get more supplies. We can both work out what we are doing to do.”
They walked until the sun angled low and turned the plains copper. Neither of them spoke much after the first argument, each carrying too many thoughts and not enough trust to share them.

Alcuin set the pace deliberately. Fast enough to put distance between them and the boundary, slow enough that Ksena would not collapse before night.

When he stopped beside a low ridge, she dropped her pack and sat without waiting for instruction.

"Water first," he said.

She obeyed.

"Small sips."

"I know how to drink," she muttered.

"Out here people forget when they're angry."

That was true enough that she did not argue.

They made camp in near silence. Alcuin built the fire ring from flat stones, checked wind direction, then scattered a thin line of ash downwind to mark movement if something approached in the dark. Ksena watched him work and felt useless.

"Tell me what to do," she said finally.

He handed her a knife and two root bulbs. "Peel these. Not your fingers."

"Very funny."

"I wasn't joking."

She peeled carefully while he dressed a small game animal. The smell made her stomach twist and growl at the same time.

When food was ready, they ate facing opposite directions like strangers sharing a fire by accident.

After a while Ksena said, "I'm sorry."

Alcuin kept his eyes on the dark beyond the flames. "For which part?"

"All of it."

He let the answer sit.

"I know it wasn't your plan," he said at last. "I'm still angry."

"You should be."

"I'm also not leaving you to die because elders are cowards."

She hugged her knees and stared into the fire. "I don't know how to be this person."

"Neither do I," he said. "We'll learn quickly or we won't learn at all."

Night sounds built around them: insects, distant calls, wind over dry grass.

At second watch, Alcuin woke her for guard shift and showed her how to keep the fire low without letting it die.

"If it flares," he whispered, "we become visible for too far. If it dies, we freeze and attract scavengers by smell."

"No pressure."

"Exactly."

He slept lightly while she watched shadows move and disappear. Every rustle sounded like wolves. Every gust sounded like footsteps.

At dawn they broke camp quickly and headed toward a market village Alcuin knew by reputation.

By midday they reached a shallow stream and followed it east until smoke columns appeared on the horizon.

The market village sat in a natural bowl protected by stone outcrops. Traders moved between open stalls built from canvas and scavenged metal poles. It was louder and rougher than either of their homes.

Alcuin pulled his hood forward.

"Let me talk first," he said.

"I can talk."

"I know. Let me talk first anyway."

They approached a supply stall run by a broad-shouldered woman with scarred hands.

"Need anything?" she asked.

Alcuin set out two trade items from his pack. "Dried hide strips and carved hooks. Looking for map updates and salt."

Her eyes flicked to Ksena and narrowed at once. "City girl?"

"Exile," Alcuin said before Ksena could answer.

The woman grunted. "Same trouble, different robe."

She traded them a rough local map, two salt packets, and a warning for free.

"Don't camp near the south wells. Raiders skim them at night."

They thanked her and moved on.

At another stall they bought thread and a second water skin. At a third they we're refused service outright when the vendor noticed Ksena's features.

"I don't trade with flame blood," he said. "Leave."

Ksena stepped forward. "I have coin."

"Keep it."

Alcuin touched her sleeve and pulled her away before it turned into a scene.

"You said this would happen," she said, voice tight.

"Yes."

"I thought maybe you we're wrong."

"I wanted to be."

Near the edge of the market, an old map-seller called them over with two fingers. His table was covered in faded chart scraps weighted by stones.

"You walk like people with nowhere safe," he said. "That means you need better than market gossip."

Alcuin eyed him. "At what price?"

"Story for story."

They traded three lines of truth for one line of direction. Alcuin told him they we're headed toward old ruins beyond the plains. The old man pointed with a stained fingernail.

"Follow dry river spine north. When you see split rock shaped like a jaw, turn west. Don't cross the glass field at noon."

Ksena frowned. "Glass field?"

"Ancient burn scar," he said. "Looks dead. Cuts feet to ribbons if light is wrong."

She glanced at Alcuin, who nodded and paid him in smoked meat anyway.

They left the market before sunset to avoid being followed.

On the road out, they heard raised voices behind them.

A young trader ran up, breathless. "Wait. You dropped this."

He handed Ksena a small cloth pouch she had not noticed missing.

"Thank you," she said.

He shrugged awkwardly. "Not all of us hate city blood." Then he hurried back before anyone could see him too long with them.

They walked until dark and camped in a shallow dip between ridges.

While Alcuin reset the ash line, Ksena unfolded the new map by firelight.

"I still don't understand why the ritual showed me those images," she said.

"Then we go where the map points and find out," he answered.

"And if we don't like what we find?"

Alcuin tightened a knot on the water skin. "Then we survive it anyway."

She watched him for a long moment.

"You really are staying," she said.

"I said I would."

"Even if I never become ascended?"

He stared at the dark plain beyond camp. "Even then."

That was the closest thing to comfort she had felt since exile.

The next morning the wind shifted and carried the scent of rain from far north. They adjusted route for shelter points and moved before sunrise.

By midafternoon they reached the dry river spine, exactly where the map-seller promised. The path narrowed and twisted between old stone shelves, but it was easier to conceal tracks.

At one bend, Alcuin halted and held up a fist.

Three riders crossed the ridge ahead, silhouettes against bright sky.

They waited in silence until the riders passed.

"Raiders?" Ksena whispered.

"Could be scouts," Alcuin said. "Either way we stay unseen."

They took a longer route after that, adding half a day to travel but avoiding open approaches.

That night, under clouded stars, Ksena took first watch by choice.

She no longer jumped at every grass movement. She still feared the dark, but now fear came with tasks: check fire, listen downwind, count breaths, keep knife close.

When Alcuin woke for second watch, he found her awake and alert.

"You did good," he said.

She nodded, surprised how much the words mattered.

They we're still exiles. Still uncertain. Still far from anything resembling home.

But by the third day, walking side by side toward unknown ruins with a shared map and shared fire, they we're no longer falling.

They we're moving.
