Ksena, come with in, Alcuin beckoned, 
“I have something to show you”
Ksena looked towards Alcuin smiling 
“Okay coming!”
What did you want to show me?
“Well, I thought since your ritual was today, I could do a ritual that we have for good luck!”
"Oh okay, sounds fun. What do I have to do?”
“Okay, kneel on the mat and close your eyes”
Kneeling down, Ksena looked at xx one last time before closing her eyes slowly
Alcuin mumbled a chant under his breath. It was not one Ksena reorganized; she understood most of the words, but there was a couple she didn’t know the meaning. Alcuin continued chanting, changing pitch and rhythm, but repeating the chant multiple times. Finally, he stopped. 
“Okay, you can open your eyes now, feel any different?”
“Well, I feel a bit more calm now. Maybe the ritual helped with that?” Oh Alcuin looked down.
“But that was very interesting. Do you know what the words mean?” Alcuin peaked up at that. 
“I don't know it’s one the elder does to all children so they have good luck hunting. We could ask him if you want too?”
“No, no, it’s okay, I should head back soon. I still have to sneak back in, but thanks for doing the ritual for me!”

Alcuin nodded. He hoped the ritual worked; he didn’t do it with their sister and after her ascension ritual she had stopped visiting, Ksena said she was just busy but Alcuin thought it was strange, they used to get along so well beforehand and nothing and he couldn’t sneak into the city; he had tried, but the barrier remained solid.

Alcuin was glum, while Ksena belonged to the race. She had always been so friendly, and she regular come to visit, although it wasn’t acceptable and once she goes through the ritual, she would stop visiting.

“Are you okay?” Ksena asked shaking his head. Alcuin nodded 
“I'm okay, after your ascended you will have to come and visit me! And show me those special powers you always talk about. I have never seen an ascended before. I was out hunting the day you first visited with your mother.”

“It’s a promise”, Ksena raised her hand to clasp his, the contrast was very different she had never had to do any sort of physical labor and her species was more delicate overall, his hands looked brutish by comparison, trying not to dwell on it he quickly shook her hand, 
“it’s a promise, ill guide you back to at least the wall, even if I can’t come inside”
“No, it’s okay, I have to hurry. They might even know where I've come so be looking out past the wall trying.”

Ksena, come in," Alcuin beckoned, "I have something to show you."
Ksena looked towards Alcuin, smiling. "Okay, I'm coming! What did you want to show me?"
"Well, I thought since your ritual is today, I could perform a good luck ritual for you!"
"Oh, okay, sounds fun. What do I have to do?"
"Kneel on the mat and close your eyes."
Ksena knelt down, glancing at Alcuin one last time before slowly closing her eyes. Alcuin mumbled a chant under his breath.

"Well, I feel a bit calmer now. Maybe the ritual helped with that?" Ksena said.
Alcuin looked down. "But that was very interesting. Do you know what the words mean?" he asked, looking back up.
"I don't know. It’s one the elder does for all children so they have good luck hunting. We could ask him if you want to?"
"No, no, it’s okay. I should head back soon. I still have to sneak back in, but thanks for doing the ritual for me!"

Suggestions for Improvement:
	1.	Dialogue Formatting: Ensure each speaker's dialogue starts on a new line for clarity.
	2.	Consistent Tense: Maintain consistent tense throughout the narrative. Switches between past and present can confuse readers.
	3.	Show, Don't Tell: Describe emotions and actions to show how characters feel rather than directly stating it. For example, "Alcuin nodded. He hoped the ritual worked" could be shown through his actions or expressions.
	4.	Clarify Pronouns: Make sure pronouns clearly refer to the correct character to avoid confusion.
	5.	Grammar and Punctuation: Fix minor grammatical errors and ensure correct punctuation, especially with dialogue tags.
	6.	Smooth Transitions: Improve the flow of dialogue and actions to make transitions between scenes smoother.
	7.	Character Thoughts: Italicize character thoughts to distinguish them from dialogue and narration.
	8.	Expand Descriptions: Add more sensory details to enhance the setting and character actions, making the scene more vivid.
After the chant ended and the mat ritual was complete, Alcuin walked Ksena toward the barrier by the longest route through the village so they could delay the moment of parting.

Children waved as they passed. An old woman pressed a dried herb bundle into Ksena's hand and told her to burn it before dawn for clear thoughts. Ksena thanked her, unsure whether she believed in luck or simply needed to believe in something.

Near the edge path, they stopped beside a water trough where no one else was listening.

"When it's done," Alcuin said, "if you feel different, tell me honestly."

"You think I'll change that much?"

"Kalani did."

Ksena looked down at the herb bundle. "I noticed."

"Maybe it's training pressure. Maybe it's ritual. I don't know."

"If I change," she said quietly, "pull me back."

Alcuin gave a short, helpless laugh. "From inside your city?"

"Then remind me before."

He reached into his pocket and handed her a small carved token, a rough bird shape with one wing uneven.

"Keep this in your sleeve," he said. "So tomorrow isn't only theirs."

She closed her hand around it and nodded.

At the barrier she stepped through first, turned, and saw him on the other side with morning sun behind him.

"Come back," he said.

"I will," she answered.

The city swallowed her before he could reply.

That evening, back in her room, she set out the old woman's herbs, Alcuin's token, and the ceremonial cloth from her mother. Three pieces of three worlds that did not fit together.

She burned the herbs anyway.

The smoke smelled bitter and sweet.

When she finally lay down, she repeated the words from the village chant under her breath, not because she understood them, but because hearing Alcuin's voice in memory was the only thing that made sleep possible.

By dawn she was calm enough to walk into ritual.

By noon, everything would be broken.

When she woke before dawn on ritual day, Ksena touched the hidden carved bird in her sleeve and repeated the same promise she had made at the barrier.

Come back.

Then she stood, washed in cold water, and walked toward the hall without looking behind her.

At the ritual hall entrance she paused for one breath, then entered on the bell mark exactly as trained.

The stone floor was cold through the ceremonial sandals, grounding her just enough to keep moving.

She kept her breathing on a four-count and did not break stride.

One step, then another, she crossed the threshold and did not look back.

The bells faded behind her.

Only the crystal waited ahead.

She steadied herself.

Then she lifted her head and met the hall as it was.
