Ksena, come in," Alcuin called from the mat circle near the edge huts. "I have something to show you."

She crouched beside him, half smiling, half distracted by the pressure building in her chest.

"If this is another hunting superstition, you know I'm still going to make fun of you."

"Do it after," he said. "This one is for luck."

He had arranged three small stones and a strip of woven grass cord in a pattern she had never seen in the city. When she asked what it meant, he only said, "Kneel and close your eyes."

She did.

His voice dropped into a low chant, uneven at first, then steadier as he repeated the same sequence. The words were old village dialect, close enough for Ksena to catch fragments and too far for her to understand all of it.

When he stopped, the silence felt louder than the chant.

"Anything?" he asked.

Ksena opened her eyes. "Calmer, maybe. Or maybe I wanted to be calmer."

"I'll take either."

She looked at the stone pattern again. "What do the words mean?"

"The elder says it asks for clear judgment when fear is louder than sense."

"So definitely not for me, then."

Alcuin's smile vanished too quickly. "I'm serious, Ksena. After tomorrow, if something feels wrong, don't ignore it."

She watched him for a long moment. "You think I'll change like Kalani did."

"I think no one comes back from that hall the same."

They sat with that between them until the afternoon shadows lengthened.

When she stood to leave, he reached into his pocket and handed her a rough carved token, bird-shaped, one wing uneven.

"Keep it in your sleeve," he said. "So tomorrow isn't only theirs."

She closed her fingers around it and nodded.

"It's a promise," she said. "I'll come back."

At the barrier, he stopped where he always had to stop.

"Come back whole," he said.

Ksena stepped through the light and did not answer until she was already on the city side.

"I'll try."

That night she laid out her ceremonial cloth, the herb bundle from the village, and the carved bird. Three objects from three worlds that refused to fit together.

She hid the bird in her sleeve anyway.

Before dawn, she washed in cold water, tied her hair, and walked toward the ritual hall on first bell.

The stone floor inside was colder than she expected. It steadied her more than the prayers did.

One step, then another, she crossed the threshold without looking back.

The bells faded behind her.

Only the crystal waited ahead.

She raised her head.

Whatever came next, it would not return what it took.
