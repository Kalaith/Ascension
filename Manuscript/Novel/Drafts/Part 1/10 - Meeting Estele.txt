The outpost looked temporary until Ksena stayed long enough to notice how permanent the routines were.

Canvas roofs patched over old stone foundations.

Trade fires burning in shifts.

Guards pretending to be merchants and merchants pretending not to notice.

Alcuin lowered his voice as they approached.

"Simple story. Buy food. Buy route intel. Leave before dark."

Ksena pulled hood lower.

"And if someone asks where we're from?"

"We lie less than they do."

The central lane was crowded with trappers, cart teams, fish sellers, and three dialects arguing over price and weight. Ksena felt eyes on them before she found source.

A woman in travel leathers leaned against supply post, watching Alcuin the way predators watched weather.

Not hostile.

Interested.

She pushed off post and crossed directly to them.

"You need a guide," she said.

Alcuin didn't flinch.

"Do we?"

"If your plan is to walk temple line with bandaged limbs and half a ration bag, yes."

Ksena and Alcuin exchanged a quick look.

The woman noticed and smiled without warmth.

"Name's Estele," she said. "I know the northern ridges, old station paths, and which checkpoints are city-aligned this week."

"This week?" Ksena asked.

"Everything changes weekly when command pressure spikes," Estele replied. "You two look like command pressure."

Alcuin folded arms.

"What do you want?"

"Payment. Decision authority in active danger. No arguments during contact events."

"That's not a guide," Alcuin said. "That's partial command."

"Then hire someone cheaper and die politely," Estele said.

She turned to leave.

Ksena stepped forward.

"Wait."

Estele stopped.

"What can you prove right now?" Ksena asked.

Estele looked amused.

"You want a credibility test before lunch? Fine."

She pointed to Ksena's wrapped pack.

"You are carrying old-route copies marked in mixed script. You got them from a sealed structure, not market purchase, because your oil wrap is stained with mineral dust from subgrade corridors, not surface roads. You were tracked at least once in the last day because your walk pattern keeps checking rear-left line. And your friend limps from thigh wound wrapped by someone competent but rushed."

She looked at Alcuin.

"Am I close?"

Alcuin said nothing.

Ksena answered.

"Close enough to keep talking."

They moved to side stall under torn awning and negotiated terms over watered tea.

Estele demanded:

- three silver strips upfront,
- one route share copy at contract end,
- full obedience during active threat windows.

Alcuin countered:

- one silver now, two on milestone,
- no raw map transfer,
- joint decision authority outside combat.

Estele shook her head.

"No map, no contract."

Ksena intervened.

"Partial map at end. No origin coordinates."

Estele considered.

"Accepted. But if you hide active threats from me, contract void."

"Same rule both directions," Ksena said.

"Agreed."

They sealed terms by cutting a short notch in shared cord and tying it three-loop pattern, an outpost custom enforceable by local arbitration.

Before route planning, Estele took them through supply lanes with ruthless efficiency.

"You need salt tablets, not pride," she told Alcuin.

"You need two extra needle packs," she told Ksena. "You run field medicine like someone who expects more injuries. Good instinct."

"Comforting," Ksena said.

"Accurate," Estele replied.

At weapon stall, Estele rejected three spear shafts before finding one balanced for Ksena's reach.

"You'll never be Alcuin's style fighter," she said. "Stop trying. Use distance and timing."

She made Ksena run six dry thrust drills in alley while merchants pretended not to watch.

By fourth drill, Ksena's angle improved.

"Again," Estele said.

By sixth, she nodded.

"Good enough to avoid embarrassing death."

Alcuin muttered something about charming mentorship. Estele ignored him.

Near dusk, they took map room above caravan office, one table, one lantern, one lockable door. Estele spread three route sheets and weighted corners with stone chips.

"Option one," she said, tapping north arc, "fastest path to archive city, highest checkpoint exposure."

"Option two," tap east ridge, "temple line first, slower but lower density lanes."

"Option three," tap mixed zigzag, "black-route chain through ruined districts. Highest ambush risk, lowest formal detection."

Ksena studied overlays.

"We're going temple line first," she said.

Estele nodded immediately.

"Good. Means you value sequence over drama."

Alcuin pointed to red marks along route.

"These?"

"Recent strike zones and controlled-burn claims," Estele said. "Could be city enforcement. Could be someone borrowing city methods to shift blame."

Ksena held still.

"We've seen one burn site already."

Estele's expression tightened.

"Then we move at dawn and avoid all open settlements until first temple marker."

A knock at door interrupted planning.

Outpost clerk entered with message slate and left without comment. It was addressed to Estele.

She read, swore under breath, and slid it across table.

Search notice.

Description matched Ksena and Alcuin loosely enough to be dangerous.

Signed with auxiliary seal tied to city outer-command.

No direct father name.

Same intent.

"Contract just got expensive," Estele said.

"You can walk," Alcuin said.

"I could," she answered. "I won't."

"Why not?"

Estele leaned back in chair.

"Because your father's reach is bad for business," she said. "And because if command starts burning roads to recover one failed candidate, everyone in these lanes pays eventually."

Ksena looked at her carefully.

"So this isn't only money."

"Nothing this week is only money," Estele said.

They finalized route in six movement blocks:

1. Pre-dawn departure through west drainage lane.
2. No-fire transit to stone spine marker.
3. Midday hide in shadow canyon.
4. Twilight crossing to dry basin.
5. Night move along old relay cuts.
6. First temple approach at civil dawn day two.

Before lights-out, Estele ran one more test.

"If I say drop and split right, what do you do?" she asked Ksena.

"Drop, split right, count five, regroup at prior marker if no contact."

"And if Alcuin does something heroic?"

"I drag him by his collar later," Ksena said.

Alcuin looked offended. Estele laughed once.

"Good."

They slept in shifts in locked room.

Ksena took second watch and stood by window slit looking down at outpost lanes gone dark except for perimeter braziers.

She felt both heavier and steadier than she had at exile gate.

Heavier from what she'd seen.

Steadier from what she now had.

A partner.

A guide.

A route.

At first gray light, Estele kicked embers from travel stove and strapped her pack.

"Move," she said. "Temple line starts now."

They exited outpost in single file, no ceremony, no farewells.

By midday Ksena stopped feeling like an exile and started feeling like part of a hunting party aimed at history.

She was not sure which was more dangerous.

She was sure it was better than waiting to be defined by people who called control mercy.

They made first-day movement clean through two route blocks before stopping in shadow cut beneath leaning basalt wall.

Estele called halt with one hand signal and dropped to one knee over dust pattern.

"Three sets passed here last night," she said. "Two heading east. One doubled back."

Alcuin scanned ridge.

"City scouts?"

"Could be. Could be contract trackers cashing search notices."

Ksena crouched beside her.

"Can they read our trail?"

Estele gave her a look that was almost approving.

"Anyone can read panic trail. Yours is cleaner than panic. Not clean enough yet."

She spent the next hour drilling both of them on trail discipline while they moved:

- step placement on hard edge,
- heel-roll control on loose gravel,
- using scrub shadows to break silhouette,
- no repeated pause patterns.

By the time they reached twilight crossing, Ksena's calves burned and her concentration felt razor-thin.

Estele noticed and called five-minute hydration break before either of them asked.

"If you wait until collapse to drink, you're already making bad decisions," she said.

Night move through relay cuts was worse. Narrow walls trapped sound, and every small scrape felt loud enough to signal half the plains. Once, distant flare lit western sky and all three dropped flat in the same second without speaking.

When flare died, Estele whispered, "Good. Keep that reflex."

They reached first temple approach ridge at civil dawn of day two, exactly on schedule.

Below lay broken altar stones half-swallowed by brush and a collapsed outer wall shaped like a ring split in one place.

Ksena felt that pulse in her wrist again, stronger than before.

"This is it," she said.

Estele looked from altar to Ksena.

"Then this is where your story stops being rumor and starts being evidence."

Alcuin adjusted spear grip.

"Same rules?"

Ksena answered before Estele could.

"Observe. Verify. Choose. Move."

Estele's mouth twitched.

"Good. Let's begin."

At ridge edge above the temple, all three paused on instinct.

No speeches.

No promises.

Just one shared breath before entering the next phase.

Then they moved.

Ksena checked her sleeve seam one more time, felt the carved bird, and nodded once to herself.

Evidence in pack.

Rules in mind.

Team in place.

It was enough to start.
