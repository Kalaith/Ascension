The plains between the hidden station and the trade outpost looked simple on the map.

They were not simple on foot.

By day two, every step hurt somewhere new. Wind changed without warning. Dry channels that looked stable collapsed under weight. Heat rose off stone by noon and dropped to knife-cold after dusk.

Ksena stopped counting hours and started counting water sips.

Three per checkpoint.

One extra if dizziness started.

None for comfort.

Alcuin shifted them to staggered movement after sunrise: twenty minutes pace, two minutes scan, twenty minutes pace. It slowed distance and increased survival odds.

"We're being watched," he said once without looking at her.

"How sure?"

"Enough to stop pretending otherwise."

He showed her sign she'd missed: pebbles set in triplet line at edge of wash, a hunter code meaning observed passage.

Not city code.

Not random.

Someone local, disciplined, and close enough to be confident.

They altered route immediately.

At midday they crossed ridge and saw smoke.

Too thick for cook fire.

Too narrow for brush burn.

Alcuin crouched and raised two fingers for silence. They approached from lee side and reached a broken wall overlooking what had once been a small settlement.

It was burned to frame posts.

Roof beams collapsed inward.

Store pit blasted open.

Bodies covered with hastily pulled cloth where survivors had tried and failed to complete burial before leaving.

Ksena climbed down before Alcuin could stop her.

At center lane she found a woman curled around two children under an overturned cart frame.

No movement.

No survivors.

The first sound she made was not a word.

It was air leaving her in one broken pull.

Alcuin reached her shoulder.

"We mark first," he said quietly. "Then we grieve."

She nodded because she could not speak.

They worked until dusk, setting stone markers, moving remains to shade, and recording identifying details where possible: pendant marks, woven clan patterns, cut-stone tokens.

No ritual flames.

No speeches.

Only labor.

At edge of square, Ksena found impact glass fused into soil in a clean circle, too hot and focused for ordinary fire.

She knelt, touched edge with knife tip, and watched metal discolor instantly.

"Ascendant output," she said.

Alcuin scanned horizon.

"Or weaponized thermal tech. Either way this wasn't raider chaos."

They camped without fire in drainage cut one kilometer east.

Ksena sat with back to stone and stared at her hands until dark erased detail.

"I keep seeing their faces," she said.

"Good," Alcuin answered.

She turned sharply.

"Good?"

"Good you remember they were people, not numbers. Just don't let memory turn into reckless choices."

"You sound like a briefing slate."

"And you sound like someone ready to sprint at the next target without a plan."

Silence slammed down.

When she spoke again, voice was low and dangerous.

"My sister may have done this."

"Maybe," Alcuin said. "Which is why we need proof before we act, not after we bury ourselves beside them."

She wanted to argue.

She wanted to burn something.

She did neither.

Instead she pulled out field slate and rewrote the headings from earlier.

Known.

Suspected.

Unverified.

Under known she added: settlement destroyed by controlled high-heat strikes.

Under suspected: Kalani involvement probable but unconfirmed.

Under unverified: direct command source.

"Better," Alcuin said after reading.

Second watch, he woke her with a hand over her mouth.

Movement above cut.

Two silhouettes passed ridge line and paused exactly where their hidden camp would have been if they'd taken obvious shelter.

"They're tracking patterns," Alcuin whispered.

"Can they see us?"

"Not if we stay stone-still and lucky."

They stayed still until silhouettes moved on.

At dawn they broke camp without food, choosing distance over breakfast.

By midmorning fatigue made everything short.

Short breath.

Short temper.

Short patience.

When Alcuin changed route again to avoid open gully, Ksena snapped.

"If we keep detouring we'll never reach the outpost."

"If we keep straight lining we'll never reach anything."

"You don't know that."

"I know terrain."

"And I know why we're out here in the first place."

He stopped walking.

"Say it."

"I failed ritual. You got dragged with me."

"Wrong," he said, voice tight. "Your father chose this. We survive it together or not at all. Stop carrying all blame like it's useful equipment."

The words cut because they were true.

They moved in silence for an hour.

Near noon, a sudden flare of heat hit from left ridge.

Not attack.

Signal.

A deliberate vertical plume, bright then gone.

Alcuin shoved Ksena behind stone as second plume lit farther west.

"Two-point communication," he said. "They're relaying position."

"Ours?"

"Likely. Move."

They ran hard through broken channels until Ksena's lungs burned raw. At a narrow split, Alcuin misstepped and slammed shoulder-first into rock. His controlled flame flickered uncontrolled along his forearm, white-hot and jagged.

He cursed, tried to contain it, failed, and punched the wall to ground himself.

The stone didn't just crack. It hissed. The flare bleached the rock white where his fist connected, evaporating the moisture in the stone with a sound like a screaming kettle. The smell of ozone and singed hair filled the narrow gap.

Ksena stared, backing away until her shoulders hit the opposite wall.

"Alcuin-"

"Don't." His voice shook. "Not now."

The flare collapsed after four breaths, leaving him pale and furious.

"How long has that been happening?" she asked.

"Long enough."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Because we already had enough problems without adding one more unstable ascendant to your list."

Hurt flashed through her before anger covered it.

"You're not a list item. You're my partner."

He looked away.

"Then I failed at acting like one for ten seconds. We move."

They moved.

By dusk they reached an old culvert line with partial roof and finally stopped. No words for first ten minutes. Just breathing and checking no immediate pursuit.

Ksena pulled med roll, cleaned scrape on his shoulder, and reset his arm wrap.

"I'm angry," she said while tying knot.

"I know."

"I'm still here."

He met her eyes then, guilt and relief both visible.

"I know that too."

They shared ration in silence that felt less hostile and more exhausted.

After dark, Ksena took first watch while Alcuin slept against pack with spear across knees. She watched starlight shift over culvert edge and let the day settle into something she could use.

Not grief alone.

Not rage alone.

Method.

At dawn she woke him and pointed to bird flight patterns above northern ridge.

"Water source there," she said.

He followed line, nodded once.

"Good read."

They reached water by midmorning and found old caravan stakes nearby, plus one carved post marked with trade symbol.

Outpost was close.

Before moving on, Ksena updated field slate again.

Known:
- Organized trackers using relay flares.
- Burn pattern consistent with deliberate strike.
- Alcuin output instability under extreme stress.

Suspected:
- Search net includes both city-aligned and independent groups.

Unverified:
- Exact command chain for village burn.

Then she added one new line beneath all three headings.

Confirm before acting.

Alcuin read it and nodded.

"Good."

By afternoon they reached high rise overlooking trade outpost lanes: patched canvas roofs over old foundations, smoke columns in rotation, armed merchants pretending not to be armed.

Safety was still not the right word.

But it was structure.

And structure meant options.

Ksena adjusted hood, checked hidden map wrap, and looked to Alcuin.

"We go in with one story," she said.

"Travelers. Route buyers. No ritual talk."

"And if someone already knows us?"

"Then we find out how much before we choose trust."

She took one last look at burned horizon behind them.

They had crossed fear, hunger, pursuit, and each other.

None of it made them safe.

It made them ready for the next decision.

"Let's move," she said.

They descended toward the outpost where a woman in travel leathers already watched the gate like she had been expecting them.

At the last bend before the outpost road, Ksena stopped and looked at Alcuin.

"One more thing," she said.

He waited.

"About earlier. The flare on your arm."

He exhaled slowly.

"I know."

"We're not hiding instability from each other again."

"Agreed."

"Say it properly."

"I agree," he said, meeting her eyes. "No more silence where it can get us killed."

She nodded.

"Good."

Then she pulled the carved bird from sleeve lining, checked the stitch, and tucked it back in place.

"You still carry that?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Even now?"

"Especially now."

He almost smiled.

"Right. Let's meet your mysterious watcher."

They stepped onto outpost road together, no longer clean, no longer naive, and no longer improvising every rule from scratch.

Whatever came next, they had structure.

Structure meant they could absorb shock without shattering.

That had to be enough.

As they descended, Ksena touched the slate in her pack and felt a strange, unwelcome comfort.

For the first time since ritual failure, she had something stronger than panic.

Process.

Process could hold when emotions could not.

By the time outpost walls came fully into view, both of them had made the same private commitment.

No more improvising identity in every crisis.

They would define terms first whenever possible.
