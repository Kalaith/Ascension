Morning in Ksena's city began with bells, not sunlight.

By first bell, corridor doors opened in order and flame-robed adults moved to stations with practiced precision. By second bell, household logs were updated, food allocations recorded, and training rosters confirmed. Nothing happened by accident. Nothing happened without witness.

Ksena was sixteen and already tired of being watched.

She stood in the kitchen hall holding a ladle over thin grain broth while two girls her age whispered at the far counter, pretending not to look at her.

Tomorrow all three would stand for ritual.

Only one of them crossed the barrier when no one was looking.

"Good luck, candidate," a guard said as she returned her bowl.

Everyone said that now.

Good luck, candidate.

Good luck as if luck could matter in a room run by elders who had already decided who would become useful.

She nodded politely and moved through west corridor toward training court.

At the first junction, a bell struck out of sequence and two wardens turned into her lane.

"Candidate Ksena," one called. "Preparation check moved forward. Report to upper district now."

She kept her face calm and bowed once.

"Yes, Warden."

The city was beautiful in the way polished stone was beautiful. Clean lines. Curated gardens. Flame lanterns set at exact intervals. No trash in gutters. No loud arguments in public lanes. No children running where work units passed.

No one called it control.

They called it order.

At the edge of parade square, she paused at the memorial wall and traced one name with her thumb.

Kalani.

Her older sister had ascended the previous year and changed so quickly Ksena still did not know where one version ended and the next began. Before ritual, Kalani had laughed too loud, asked foolish questions, and smuggled sweets from market kitchens to village children outside the barrier.

After ritual, Kalani spoke in strategy terms and stood beside elders like she had been born forty years older.

"You are late," Kalani said now from behind her.

Ksena turned.

Kalani's flame dress moved like controlled fire over her shoulders, bright and unnaturally steady.

"I had kitchen duty," Ksena replied.

"You had poor timing," Kalani said, then softened just enough to sound human. "Come. Mother wants to see you before council hour."

They crossed upper district in silence.

Their mother's quarters overlooked inner gardens and the old crystal hall. She was waiting near the balcony rail, posture perfect, expression unreadable.

"Sit," she said.

Ksena sat.

Kalani stayed standing.

"Tomorrow is not ceremony," their mother said. "It is alignment. You will do exactly what ritual master instructs. No improvisation. No arguing."

"I know," Ksena said.

"Do you?"

The question was quiet. It still stung.

Ksena looked down at her hands.

"I know how to follow directions," she said.

Her mother watched her for a long moment, then glanced at Kalani.

"You will escort her to preparation wing at first bell."

Kalani nodded.

"Yes, Mother."

Their mother dismissed them with a gesture and returned to the balcony without another word.

In corridor, Ksena exhaled hard.

"Does she ever talk to us like daughters?" she asked.

Kalani did not answer immediately.

"She talks to us like survivors," she said at last.

That should have sounded wise.

It sounded tired.

By evening, bells shifted to curfew rhythm. Ksena lay on her narrow bed, staring at stone ceiling while distant patrol steps echoed through the walls.

She should have been sleeping.

Instead she counted everything she was supposed to become tomorrow.

Ascended.

Disciplined.

Useful.

She rolled to one side and pulled a wrapped token from under the bed, a rough wooden bird carved by village hands outside the barrier. One wing was uneven.

She ran her thumb over the notch and hid it in her sleeve.

If tomorrow changed everything, she wanted at least one thing that was still hers.

At last bell, she sat up and looked toward the dark outline of crystal hall through her window slit.

It waited in silence like a mouth.

She told herself she was ready.

She did not believe it.
