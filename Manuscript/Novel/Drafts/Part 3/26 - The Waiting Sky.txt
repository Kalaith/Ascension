The extraction was not clean.

They hit the ground running. The lower roof was slick with condensation. Alarms screamed above them.

"This way!" Kirk shouted from the maintenance ladder. He had the skiff engines warming in the alley below. "We have heavy pursuit!"

"We know!" Alcuin yelled back, sliding down the rungs.

Ksena landed last, the Key burning a hole in her pocket.

"Go! Go!"

They scrambled into the skiff. Kirk gunned the thrusters before the ramp closed.

The craft shot up the narrow canyon of buildings, banking hard to avoid a patrol drone.

"Clear air in ten seconds!" Kirk warned.

Then the roof exploded.

Kalani hit the ridge above them with two fast strikes, forcing debris into the launch lane. Kirk shoved throttle forward before the second wave landed.

Acceleration pinned everyone to their seats. Alcuin swore into his harness. Ksena tried to look back and could not move her head against the force.

A third strike passed close enough to shake the frame.

"She is reading our climb," Kirk shouted. "I need a disruption window now."

Ksena unstrapped one side, braced against the hatch frame, and forced a thermal flare into the canyon floor behind them. The false signature bloomed bright in Kalani's pursuit line.

Kalani broke right to follow it.

Kirk used the two-second gap and drove the craft through a narrow stone split, then into cloud cover.

By the time Kalani corrected, they were gone.

Alcuin dropped his head between his knees and fought vertigo while the craft leveled.

"Tell me this flight ends soon," he said.

"One hour," Kirk answered. "Try not to pass out before then."

Ksena kept eyes on instruments, jaw tight.

"She is faster than before," she said.

"Then next time we pick ground where speed is useless," Alcuin replied.

They touched down in a dry ravine with engines ticking hot and everyone shaking from adrenaline.

No one called it a win.

They had not beaten Kalani.

They had escaped.

And they had the Key.

Ksena pulled the crystal shard from her pocket. It pulsed slowly, a deep, rhythmic beat that matched the humming in the air.

"This stops the barrier?" Estele asked, looking at it warily.

"It controls the lock," Ksena said. "If we put this in the receiver at the High Temple, we can drop the shield."

"Or raise it," Grandmother added. "To keep the fleet out."

"If we're fast enough," Alcuin said, looking at the sky.

The fleet arrived like weather turning violent.

Ksena saw the first hull break cloud and felt old fear move through her spine before thought caught up.

Then more shapes followed.

Carriers.

Heavy escorts.

Fast wedges peeling toward strategic corridors.

Within minutes the sky was no longer sky. It was occupied geometry.

Kirk lowered binoculars and did not bother softening his read.

"That is not reconnaissance," he said. "That is staging for control."

Alcuin spread a cloth map over a flat stone and anchored corners with spent casings.

"If they hold these three canyons," he said, tapping each route in turn, "lowland supply dies in two days."

Ksena forced herself to count instead of panic.

Hull spacing.

Descent vectors.

Escort pattern.

Whoever commanded the formation had studied terrain and chosen pressure points deliberately.

"Western settlements first," she said. "If passes close before warning, half the civilian population gets trapped by dusk."

Kirk keyed his headset and transmitted burst priority to orbit command.

"Captain can shadow edge lanes," he said, listening to static and delayed confirmations. "We cannot contest full orbit alone. Ground movement starts now."

Ksena nodded.

The sky above was terrifying.

The ground beneath her boots still required decisions.

She split routes in under a minute.

Alcuin to ridge clans and canyon wardens.

Kirk to aerial recon and comm relay.

Ksena to city gate command table and emergency corridor authority.

No one argued.

They moved.

At the first fork, Alcuin caught her arm.

"Do not negotiate from guilt," he said. "Negotiate from leverage."

She almost laughed at the timing.

"When did you become strategic?"

"Around the third city trying to kill us."

He ran west.

Kirk launched with two scouts and climbed toward cloud shelf where radar shadows were thin.

Ksena took the south trail at full speed.

"Phase two is coming," she whispered to the wind. "Keep moving."

The enemy had arrived in force.

This time they would meet a world that remembered and adapted.

And this time, the world had a Key.
