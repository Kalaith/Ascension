Ksena circled the marked stone ring twice before she let anyone step into position.

"Are you sure?" she asked grandmother. "This draw will be heavy, and you've only just recovered."

Grandmother rolled her shoulders and planted her cane against the wall.

"I am sure," she said. "The temples carried residual charge. Here we carry it ourselves. That is the difference, not the purpose."

Estele stood at the center mark, hands flexing at her sides.

"You can still walk away," Ksena said.

Estele shook her head. "No. I am done being the person who watches other people decide my future."

Alcuin took his place opposite Ksena, jaw tight.

"Talk me through it again," he said.

Grandmother nodded once. "Three anchors. One receiver. Do not force output. Let the stream align and pull. If alignment destabilizes, I cut the sequence."

Ksena looked from Alcuin to Estele and back.

"Ready?"

Both nodded.

They ignited together.

Heat rose in layered bands, first orange, then white at the edges. Power ran from Alcuin through Ksena, from Ksena through grandmother, and spiraled inward toward Estele in tightening loops.

At first it felt manageable.

Then the pull sharpened.

Alcuin's knees trembled as the drain accelerated. Ksena tasted iron at the back of her throat. Grandmother's breathing turned ragged, and Ksena felt her compensating with borrowed output from both of them to keep the circuit stable.

Estele cried out once, then went silent, eyes shut, jaw locked.

Fire climbed her arms, then settled over her shoulders like living cloth. Symbols flashed across her skin and vanished. Her frame shifted by degrees, not grotesque, but undeniable.

Outside the room, Kirk saw light spill under the door hard enough to paint the corridor white.

Then the chamber flashed.

All three anchors dropped to one knee as the draw released.

Estele remained standing in the center, flames moving around her in controlled loops.

Kirk burst in, stopped, and stared.

"Is everyone alive?"

Alcuin laughed once despite exhaustion. "Barely."

Ksena pushed up on shaking arms and grabbed grandmother before she could fall.

"You said this would be manageable."

Grandmother gave her a tired look. "I said it would be possible."

Estele lifted one hand, summoned a narrow flame, widened it, then collapsed it back to spark with deliberate control.

She stared at her palm in disbelief.

"It worked," she said. "I am ascended."

Ksena hugged her hard enough to break posture.

"Welcome," she said. "Now we make sure it means more than rank."

Kirk, still catching up, pointed at the circle marks.

"How soon can we run this again?"

Grandmother gave him a withering stare.

"After sleep. Preferably after food. Possibly after I stop seeing double."

No one argued.

By dusk, camp settled into quiet recovery. Katesh paced between bedrolls, checked each of them in turn, then curled beside the door as if guarding a threshold no one else could see.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

The transformed recruit asked quietly whether they were still the same person after the ritual. Ksena answered the only way she could: 'You are you, plus a burden you cannot ignore.' It was not comforting, but it was true.

When Alcuin's ascension stabilized, camp went silent.

The transformation had not made him unrecognizable, but it had erased the old boundaries both factions treated as permanent. Bone structure shifted toward shared line norms. Skin tone deepened. Flame response synchronized with patterns previously labeled "city-only." 

Ksena stared at him and saw the central lie exposed in one living body.

They had never been separate species.

They had been separated by policy.

Alcuin looked at his hands in firelight.

"Say it," Ksena said softly.

He exhaled once.

"If others can do this, then your elders did not guard power. They hoarded it."

She nodded.

"And they killed to protect the monopoly."

That night no one slept much.

By dawn, shock had to become planning.

If ascension could propagate through transfer outside council control, then every village with mixed lineage became both recruitment ground and target.

Kirk rewrote priority board in blunt terms.

"Order matters," he said. "Message before rumor. Structure before panic."

They built a three-layer rollout:

1. Quiet contact with trusted village leaders.
2. Controlled demonstration with independent witnesses.
3. Written doctrine that rejected bloodline supremacy and forced ritual.

Ksena drafted the core statement with grandmother's edits and Alcuin's field language:

Ascension is inheritance, not rank.

No one owns access.

No one is forced.

No line is born above another.

It looked simple on the page and explosive in practice.

First courier left at noon with the message sewn into jacket lining and a fallback copy sealed in wax tube.

Ksena watched him disappear over dust ridge and understood a threshold had been crossed.

They were no longer only fugitives trying to survive.

They were distributing a truth the existing order could not absorb peacefully.

"How long until response?" Alcuin asked.

Kirk checked route timings.

"Fastest, three days for northern settlements. Slower where patrol density is high."

"And retaliation?"

Kirk did not soften it.

"Could begin before first confirmations return."

By evening they had contingency routes marked, emergency rendezvous points updated, and decoy packet plans in place in case original couriers were intercepted.

Grandmother reviewed the board, tapped one gap, and looked at Ksena.

"You still think this is only about exposing lies," she said. "It is also about managing what comes after people believe you."

Ksena met her gaze.

"Then we build that too."

The first reply arrived on day four.

One line, hand-carried, no signature:

If this is true, prove it where witnesses cannot be bought.

Ksena folded the note and handed it to Alcuin.

He read it once and smiled without humor.

"Good," he said. "Skepticism means they are still thinking for themselves."

Kirk packed demonstration kit before sunrise.

As they broke camp, Ksena looked east where her city's old command lines still held people in place.

Truth was moving now.

Slow, uneven, and dangerous.

But moving.

That was enough.

Three days later, they held the first public proof where no one faction controlled the ground.

The meeting point was a dry amphitheater between trade routes, visible from three ridge approaches and far enough from city patrol lanes to reduce immediate interference.

Witnesses arrived in suspicious clusters: two village elders, one anti-ascendant quartermaster, four neutral traders, one former ritual clerk, and a pair of armed mediators who refused to remove weapons until after the first hour.

Ksena did not open with speeches.

She opened with records.

Fragments of old temple doctrine.

Barrier control tags.

Crystal suppression markers.

Cross-verified dates from three independent archives.

Then she stepped back and let grandmother speak in old legal cadence that none of them expected to hear outside a city chamber.

"Ascension was communal charge before it was private command," grandmother said. "Your histories were narrowed to make obedience feel ancestral."

No one applauded.

They interrogated every point.

For two hours, questions came sharp and personal.

Who decides eligibility now?

What stops a new monopoly from forming?

Why trust former city bloodlines at all?

Alcuin answered most of those, not Ksena.

"Do not trust us by default," he said. "Trust process you can verify and challenge."

The final witness, an elderly warden who had lost two sons in crystal enforcement raids, asked for the one thing they had prepared and feared.

"Show me."

The demonstration stayed controlled.

No spectacle.

No large-output displays.

Estele ran a small channel sequence under grandmother's supervision while two witnesses checked pulse, heat, and output drift from arm's length.

Then Ksena invited the former ritual clerk to inspect the same sequence markers and compare them against council doctrine books he carried himself.

His hands shook while he read.

"These patterns are older," he said quietly. "And broader."

That changed the room.

Not into trust.

Into reluctant consideration.

When the sun dropped, they left with no declaration signed, no alliance sealed, and no cheering crowds.

They left with something harder and more durable.

Witnesses who had seen enough to challenge the old story in their own communities without relying on Ksena's name.
