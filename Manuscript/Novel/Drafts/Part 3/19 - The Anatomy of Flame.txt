"Stop," grandmother said, her cane hitting the packed earth with a sharp crack that echoed across the training yard.

Ksena lowered her hands, breathing hard. Sweat stung her eyes.

"It was holding," she argued.

"A collapsing roof holds until it kills you," grandmother snapped. "You are forcing the channel. Again."

"It's the only way I know!"

"Then unlearn it."

The yard was quiet. The other recruits—villagers who had never held power, guards who had only known crystal-filtered commands—watched them with a mix of awe and terror. They were weeks into training, and 'progress' felt like a word for other people.

Ksena wiped her face with a muddy sleeve. "The crystal filters regulated the flow. Without them, it's... it's like trying to drink from a waterfall."

"Yes," grandmother said, stepping closer. "And if you do not learn to swallow, you drown. Do you think the Ancestors had regulators? Do you think they asked for permission from a rock?"

She turned to the line of recruits.

"This," she pointed at Ksena, "is what dependence looks like. She has power, but she has no language for it. She is shouting when she should be whispering."

She pointed to a young boy at the end of the line. Teo. He was fourteen, with hands rough from field work.

"Teo. Step forward."

The boy swallowed but moved up.

"Show her," grandmother commanded.

Teo closed his eyes. He didn't take a stance. he didn't tense. He just breathed.

A small, perfectly spherical flame bloomed in his cupped hand. It didn't waver. It didn't roar. It spun slowly, orange and gold, stable as a stone.

"See?" grandmother said softly. "He doesn't fight it. He invites it."

Ksena stared at the flame. It made her angry. It made her jealous. And it made her ashamed.

"How?" she asked Teo.

"I... I just think about the warmth in the soil," Teo stammered. "Before the sprout comes up. It's pushing, but it's patient."

"Patience," grandmother repeated, looking at Ksena. "The one weapon you refuse to carry."

That afternoon was brutal.

Grandmother stripped away the combat drills. No fireballs. No shields. No kinetic strikes.

"Feel the current," she ordered. "Do not shape it. Just feel it."

For Ksena, it was torture. The power sat under her skin, itching, demanding release. Every time she tried to just *hold* it, it spiked. Sparks flew from her fingertips. The ground scorched around her boots.

"You are leaking," Alcuin muttered from beside her. He was struggling too, his brow furrowed in concentration, but his field was tighter than hers.

"Shut up," Ksena hissed.

"Focus on your own failure," grandmother called out without looking at them.

By sunset, Ksena was exhausted in a way she had never felt before. Not muscle fatigue. Soul fatigue.

She sat on the edge of the low wall, staring at her hands. They were trembling.

"It shouldn't be this hard," she said to the dark.

"It is hard because you are trying to command it," grandmother's voice came from the shadows. She sat down slowly, leaning heavily on her cane. "You treat power like a servant. 'Do this. Burn that.'"

"Isn't that what it's for?"

"No," grandmother said. "It is a partner. The crystals... your father built them to enslave the power. To strip its will so he could impose his own. When you force it, you are acting like him."

The words hit Ksena like a physical blow.

"I am nothing like him."

Order. Control. Suppression.

"Prove it," grandmother said. "Listen to the fire. Don't tell it where to go. Ask it where it wants to be."

Ksena looked at her palm.

She closed her eyes. She didn't think about the enemy. She didn't think about the war. She thought about the heat of the sun on the stone wall. The way the light moved through the leaves.

She didn't pull. She opened.

The warmth flowed into her. Not a torrent this time. A stream.

It pooled in her hand.

She opened her eyes.

A flame sat there. Blue at the heart, white at the edges. It wasn't spinning like Teo's. It was pulsing. A heartbeat.

"It... wants to breathe," Ksena whispered.

"Then let it," grandmother said.

Ksena expanded her fingers. The flame grew, inhaling. She closed them slightly. It shrank, exhaling.

It was alive.

She looked at grandmother, a smile breaking through the grime on her face.

"I hear it."

Grandmother nodded, her expression unreadable in the twilight.

"Good," she said. "Now do it while someone is trying to kill you."
