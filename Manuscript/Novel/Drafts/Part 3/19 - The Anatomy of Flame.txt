"Stop," grandmother said, her cane hitting the packed earth with a sharp crack that echoed across the training yard.

Ksena lowered her hands, breathing hard. Sweat stung her eyes, blurring the edges of the afternoon sun. Her arms felt like lead, trembling with the aftershocks of channeled energy.

"It was holding," she argued, wiping her forehead with a muddy sleeve.

"A collapsing roof holds until it kills you," grandmother snapped. She walked around Ksena, inspecting her stance like a structural engineer inspecting a faulty bridge. "You are forcing the channel. Again. You are treating the flow like a mule you can whip into obedience."

"It's the only way I know!" Ksena shouted, frustration finally boiling over. "The crystal filters regulated the flow! Without them, it's... it's like trying to drink from a waterfall!"

"Yes," grandmother said, stepping closer until she was nose-to-nose with Ksena. "And if you do not learn to swallow, you drown. Do you think the Ancestors had regulators? Do you think they asked for permission from a rock?"

She turned to the line of recruits.

The yard was quiet, filled with the smell of ozone and burnt grass. The other recruits—villagers who had never held power, guards who had only known crystal-filtered commands—watched them with a mix of awe and terror. They were weeks into training, and 'progress' felt like a word for other people. Most were nursing burns or bruises.

"Show them what happens when you force it," Grandmother commanded. "Do not hold back this tune. Let it break."

Ksena hesitated. "Grandmother..."

"Do it!"

Ksena grit her teeth. She grabbed the energy coiling in her gut and *pulled*. She didn't guide it; she shoved it towards the wooden training dummy twenty meters away.

The air shrieked.

A bolt of fire, jagged and white-hot, erupted from her hands. It didn't fly straight. It arced wildly, striking the ground ten feet in front of the dummy, then exploding upward. The shockwave knocked Ksena flat on her back.

When the dust settled, the dummy wasn't just burnt. It was gone. And so was the fence behind it. A crater of fused glass smoked in the yard.

Silence stretched tight across the field.

Grandmother looked down at Ksena, who was coughing in the dirt.

"Power without discipline is just a bomb," Grandmother said coldly. "And you are the fuse."

She turned back to the recruits.

"This," she pointed at Ksena, "is what dependence looks like. She has power, but she has no language for it. She is shouting when she should be whispering."

She pointed to a young boy at the end of the line. Teo. He was fourteen, with hands rough from field work and eyes that were always looking at the ground.

"Teo. Step forward."

The boy swallowed audibly but moved up. He looked terrified.

"Show her," grandmother commanded.

Teo closed his eyes. He didn't take a combat stance. He didn't tense his muscles. He just stood there, shoulders slumped, breathing slowly.

A small, perfectly spherical flame bloomed in his cupped hand. It didn't waver. It didn't roar. It spun slowly, orange and gold, stable as a stone. It looked solid, like a fruit made of light.

"See?" grandmother said softly, her voice carrying across the yard. "He doesn't fight it. He invites it."

Ksena stared at the flame. It made her angry. It made her jealous. And deep down, where she didn't want to look, it made her ashamed. She scrambled to her feet, brushing dirt off her pants.

"How?" she asked Teo, her voice ragged.

Teo opened his eyes. He looked at the flame, then at Ksena. "I... I just think about the warmth in the soil," he stammered. "Before the sprout comes up. It's pushing, but it's patient. It knows the sun is there. It doesn't have to scream for it."

"Patience," grandmother repeated, looking at Ksena. "The one weapon you refuse to carry."

***

That afternoon was brutal.

Grandmother stripped away the combat drills. No fireballs. No shields. No kinetic strikes.

"Feel the current," she ordered. "Do not shape it. Just feel it."

For Ksena, it was torture. The power sat under her skin, itching, demanding release. Every time she tried to just *hold* it, it spiked. Sparks flew from her fingertips, stinging her skin like angry hornets. The ground scorched around her boots.

"You are leaking," Alcuin muttered from beside her. He was struggling too, his brow furrowed in concentration, sweat dripping from his nose. But his field was tighter than hers. Darker. He wasn't radiating heat; he was radiating weight. The grass around his feet wasn't burning; it was flattening.

"Shut up," Ksena hissed.

"Focus on your own failure," grandmother called out without looking at them. She was sitting on a bench, apparently dozing, but a small pebble hovered in the air above her hand, rotating perfectly.

By sunset, Ksena was exhausted in a way she had never felt before. Not muscle fatigue. Soul fatigue. Her veins felt like they had been scrubbed with sand.

She sat on the edge of the low wall, staring at her hands. They were trembling. Red marks traced the lines of her meridians—burns from the inside out.

Teo sat down a few feet away. He held a waterskin out to her.

"Thanks," she muttered, taking a long drink. The water was warm, but it felt divine.

"My dad used to say the earth is stubborn," Teo said quietly. "If you hit it with a shovel, it jars your bones. If you slide the blade in at the right angle, it opens up."

Ksena looked at him. "And fire?"

"Fire is hungry," Teo said. "You have to feed it, or it eats you. But you can't feed it everything at once."

Ksena looked back at her hands. "I've spent my whole life being told the crystals control the hunger. That without them, we'd burn up."

"Maybe," Teo shrugged. "Or maybe they just wanted to decide who gets to eat."

The simplicity of it struck her.

"It shouldn't be this hard," she said to the dark.

"It is hard because you are trying to command it," grandmother's voice came from the shadows. She walked over slowly, leaning heavily on her cane. "You treat power like a servant. 'Do this. Burn that.'"

"Isn't that what it's for?"

"No," grandmother said. She sat down between them. "It is a partner. The crystals... your father built them to enslave the power. To strip its will so he could impose his own. When you force it, you are acting like him."

The words hit Ksena like a physical blow.

"I am nothing like him."

Order. Control. Suppression.

"Prove it," grandmother said. "Listen to the fire. Don't tell it where to go. Ask it where it wants to be."

Ksena looked at her palm.

She closed her eyes. She didn't think about the enemy. She didn't think about the war, or her father, or the burning dummy. She thought about the heat of the sun on the stone wall behind her. The way the light moved through the leaves.

She didn't pull. She opened.

The warmth flowed into her. Not a torrent this time. A stream.

It pooled in her hand.

She opened her eyes.

A flame sat there. Blue at the heart, white at the edges. It wasn't spinning like Teo's. It was pulsing. A heartbeat.

"It... wants to breathe," Ksena whispered.

"Then let it," grandmother said.

Ksena expanded her fingers. The flame grew, inhaling. She closed them slightly. It shrank, exhaling.

It was alive.

She looked at grandmother, a smile breaking through the grime on her face.

"I hear it."

Grandmother nodded, her expression unreadable in the twilight.

"Good," she said. "Now do it while someone is trying to kill you."

Ksena laughed, a short, tired sound. She closed her hand, and the flame vanished, leaving only a gentle warmth on her skin.

"Tomorrow," she said.

"Tomorrow," Grandmother agreed. "And bring extra bandages. You'll need them."
