the power not only coursed through him, it changed him, Ksena full ascension was overtaken has all eyes turned to face him, as the power coursed through his body, his frame started to compress, his skin grew smooth and darkened getting closer to a deep purple, his face changed to being more sculptured and refined and his eyes grew brighter, by the end of it his body wrapped in power, he could have been mistaken as Ksena brother and not as a different species
Ksena realized this was the truth, they where not two different people, after they had managed to repeal the ancient invaders the ascended had somehow been turned against there own race, there was only one true face and by going through the ritual with her, he had reached it, the ancient had known all along that this would have happened
now with his ascension done others from his race would do it as well, the elders were losing control this is what they had tried to hide, why they had committed these atrocities they wanted to stop them from being able to ascend and oppose them
Every time they felt one was getting close they would attack and destroy the entire village and remove all trace of it, they had likely only kept them around so they where not guilty of wiping out there forefathers and so they could continue to use them as labor.

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

The argument did not vanish, but it changed shape by morning. Instead of circling old blame, they laid out tasks: route checks, contact points, and who would speak first if they reached the next settlement under pressure.

Ksena folded the map and tucked it into her jacket.

"We can keep fighting each other," she said, "or we can spend that energy where it matters."

Alcuin gave a short nod. "Then we spend it where it matters."

They left camp with less certainty than before, but more discipline, and that was enough to keep moving.

Ksena checked the map against the ridgeline twice before giving the signal to move. Alcuin did not argue this time; he simply shifted left to cover the blind angle and waited for Kirk to confirm the rear. They moved in silence through the cut stone until the wind changed, then dropped low and held position. No patrol crossed, but they stayed down until they were sure. That caution cost them an hour and likely saved them a fight.

At camp, they no longer talked in circles. They set watch order, reviewed water levels, and marked two fallback points in case the next approach collapsed. Kirk traced likely scout paths from his field notes and handed them to Ksena without comment. She folded the sheet and slid it into oilcloth. Alcuin watched both of them and finally said what none of them had said all day: they were tired, but they were no longer improvising every step.

The hardest moments came when the road went quiet. Quiet used to feel like safety. Now it felt like an ambush waiting for shape. Ksena forced herself to keep breathing steady and count terrain exits instead of threats she could not see. Alcuin stayed close enough to pull her back if she rushed, far enough to keep both of them alive if fire came from the wrong side. They had learned that distance was not emotional. It was tactical.

By the second watch, Kirk had the flare gun across his knees and Alcuin had his spear laid within arm's reach. Ksena sat with a slate and wrote three headings: confirmed, likely, unknown. She filled each column before sleeping. When she was done, she passed it to Alcuin. He added one line under confirmed: if they fought on bad ground, they died. No one argued with that.

Dawn brought no relief, only clarity. They had one path that kept them hidden, one contact who might still be reliable, and one objective that could not wait another week. Ksena looked at the route marks and felt fear settle into focus. She did not need to feel brave. She needed to move first and doubt later. Alcuin recognized the shift and gave a short nod. That was all the encouragement either of them used now.

When discussion turned to revenge, they shut it down and returned to sequence. Entry point, signal order, withdrawal line, casualty fallback. It sounded cold and necessary. Ksena still carried grief for every burned village, but she stopped treating grief as a plan. Alcuin still carried anger at the city, but he no longer let anger pick the route. Kirk still wanted a clean mission report, but he accepted this campaign would be won in fragments.

Before leaving camp, they buried the fire and erased their tracks to the stream crossing. Alcuin doubled back once to break a clear line and then rejoined at the stone arch. Ksena waited there with the map pressed against her chest, counting heartbeats until both men were in sight. They moved out together, and for the first time in days, the rhythm felt controlled instead of desperate.

By nightfall they reached the next shelter line with enough water left for one extra day. It was a small margin, but it changed their options. Ksena marked the cache point, Kirk logged coordinates, and Alcuin set a low alarm line of stones and metal scraps. None of it was dramatic. All of it mattered. They slept in shifts and woke still in the fight.
