the power not only coursed through him, it changed him, Ksena full ascension was overtaken has all eyes turned to face him, as the power coursed through his body, his frame started to compress, his skin grew smooth and darkened getting closer to a deep purple, his face changed to being more sculptured and refined and his eyes grew brighter, by the end of it his body wrapped in power, he could have been mistaken as Ksena brother and not as a different species
Ksena realized this was the truth, they where not two different people, after they had managed to repeal the ancient invaders the ascended had somehow been turned against there own race, there was only one true face and by going through the ritual with her, he had reached it, the ancient had known all along that this would have happened
now with his ascension done others from his race would do it as well, the elders were losing control this is what they had tried to hide, why they had committed these atrocities they wanted to stop them from being able to ascend and oppose them
Every time they felt one was getting close they would attack and destroy the entire village and remove all trace of it, they had likely only kept them around so they where not guilty of wiping out there forefathers and so they could continue to use them as labor.

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

The argument did not vanish, but it changed shape by morning. Instead of circling old blame, they laid out tasks: route checks, contact points, and who would speak first if they reached the next settlement under pressure.

Ksena folded the map and tucked it into her jacket.

"We can keep fighting each other," she said, "or we can spend that energy where it matters."

Alcuin gave a short nod. "Then we spend it where it matters."

They left camp with less certainty than before, but more discipline, and that was enough to keep moving.

The next day proved the new roles worked. When a messenger arrived with conflicting reports, Ksena handled the source, Alcuin verified the route, and Kirk checked timestamps against relay drift. They reached a decision in minutes instead of an hour. No one celebrated. They just moved.

The next contact meeting proved the change was working. Ksena handled the talk, Alcuin handled exits, and Kirk handled timing. The whole exchange took twelve minutes and ended with a confirmed supply drop instead of another argument. As they walked out, Alcuin said, "I hate that this works." Ksena answered, "Me too. Keep doing it."
