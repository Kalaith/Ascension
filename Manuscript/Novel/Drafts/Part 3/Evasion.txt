Everyone sit down and do your best to put the seat belts on you, we will be moving very fast and you want to be holding on very tightly
Kirk finished canging the massive array of buttons, switches and levers that left even the curious Ksena speechless, the ship rocked as Kalani was outside attacking it
Ready to take of Kirk said into his headseat
Roger, opening main door, that banshee out there is attacking like crazy, we will need to be getting out of here s soon as you leave
alaRoger kirk replied
Alcuin watched as the door startd to open up, the ship rocked again as anothe ball of fire hit it, they could see the smoke through the open door 
As soon as the door was fully open, Ksenda could see her sister flying outside 
Hold n everyone kirk said, Alcion gripped his seat hard, the movement was still faster anyone expected as Kirk floored it, the jet taking of from the ship and just narrowly dodging the next fireball from Kalani,
Ksena wanted to turn her head to face towards Kalani and the ship but she couldn’t move her head as the zero gs passed against , she ccouldn’t see the human ship fly of in the opposite direction, or her sister go tumbling through the air at the prssure change
Okay Kirk called out, we have cleared her, she will not be able to catch up to us, she isn’t that fast, he slowed the ship a little, enough that all the force wasn’t pressing against them allowing Alcuin to breathe, the feeling was nt one he would soon forget
How long will it take to arrive Ksena yelled out
At our current speed it should only take an hour
That fast alcuin said as he tried to look out the plane and see the landscape, which was the wrong move for him and her had to cover his eyes placing his head between his legs as he recovered from the veritgo this ship was moving fast, a journey that would have taken them a month would be over in an hour, Alcuin was still unsure whic he prefered, the pressure still against his chest was painful, travel by foot would habe been much better

Eventually with his asceded powers they would learn how to fly like Kalani, Alcuin didn’t think he would rush, Ksena o the other hand was loving itm ad couldn’t wait to be able to fly for herself, this is something she would dfiantly be practising, hopefully the ascended they were going to visit would be able to teach them, between the two of them and katesh they should be able to handle her, and hopefully capture her before she can do any harm to anyone else
Ksena was still in shock about her sster, how could she do things like this, the sister she remembered was kind and gentle, the word the human had used this not describe her older sister, but she must be there somewhere and Ksena would rescue her and get to the bottom of all of this

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

The hardest part was not the danger. It was timing. Every person they needed to help was on a clock they could not see: grandmother in chains, villages under threat, allies who would lose nerve if they waited too long. Ksena felt that pressure in her chest like a second heartbeat. Alcuin saw it and did what he always did when she started to spiral. He gave her one task at a time until breathing came back.

They abandoned their old camp pattern entirely and began sleeping in rotating half-cycles so movement could resume inside any weather window. It drained them, but it denied pursuit the predictability they had been exploiting. By the fourth night, the tail widened and then vanished.

Before dawn they doubled back over a dry wash and erased the only clear approach line into camp. Kirk called it paranoid. Alcuin called it alive. Two hours later they saw fresh tracks exactly where the old line would have led. Ksena stared at the marks and exhaled hard. "We are not ahead," she said. "But we are not caught."
