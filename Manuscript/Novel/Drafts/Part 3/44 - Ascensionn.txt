Her Ascension was over, she had done it, the power ran through her body her sense heighten, power wore down on her shoulders, her power draping her body, but she felt it another power, as strong as hers building, she wasn’t the only one to have unlocked her full potential, her sisters body

Her sister had unlocked the latent potential within her, had she broken free of the control, Ksena put her hand out towards her sister, but her sister lashed out, Ksena’s power only just covering her, as her sisters power hit her and send her across the room, Ksena hit the stone altar with a thud, her power protecting her but it still knocked the wind out of her chest, she looked up to her sister standing over her
‘Thank you for this power, with this I will be among the strongest of our people, stronger mother, of the elders and you’
‘But your free from their control.. Why..’
‘Yes I am, I shook free of there control as this power coursed through me, and for controlling me they will pay I will kill them all, everyone who forced my actions
But this is just a means to an end, since its done I will be the strongest and the one in control, the army will all bow before me’
‘We could fight and remove them from power and share this with our people, we will be stronger ever, isn’t that enough’
‘No, I will finish what I started and destroy you, I was the one that stopped your ascension and not some silly ritual, I couldn’t break free of it, it already bound me, but you had the potential to outshine me, you would come moms favorite, I couldn’t let you, and by letting you escape I knew somehow you would find a way to release me.
‘Its over, goodbye sister’ her sister brought her hand up and summoned more power had been used in thousands of years, Ksena was still just brought into hr power at this close

The strike never landed.

Alcuin stepped between them, one hand raised, flame tracing a thin arc around Ksena like a shield. It shook with effort, but it held. Kalani laughed, bright and cruel, as if his intervention proved her point.

"You still think this is about freedom," Kalani said. "Freedom is for the strong. The rest obey."

Ksena rose slowly, breath ragged, new power still burning through nerves that had not learned its shape. "No," she answered. "The rest survive each other. That is what you forgot."

Power tore across the chamber. Stone cracked. One of the old temple columns split and crashed between them, spraying dust and blue sparks from buried crystal. The blast bought Kalani what she wanted: distance. She vaulted backward through the breach and vanished into the smoke before Ksena could seal the gap.

Silence settled in jagged pieces. Alcuin dropped to one knee, exhausted but conscious. Ksena knelt beside him, pressing both hands against his shoulders until his breathing steadied.

"You should have run," she whispered.

"Not from you," he said.

Outside, alarm bells began to ring through the ruins. Kalani was free, ascended, and furious. Ksena looked toward the broken wall and understood the new shape of the war. It would not be won by one ritual, one duel, or one revelation. It would be won by endurance.

She helped Alcuin to his feet. "Then we train," she said. "Harder than before. We do not get a second surprise."
