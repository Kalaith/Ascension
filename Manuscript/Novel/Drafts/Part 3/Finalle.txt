The barrier was now down, and sunlight shone down on the war ravished city, Ksena felt her heart ache at seeing it like this, it had been necessary but so much lost and for people like the elders, her sister wanting power, now there gone, while the towns inhabitants would still be open to tampering everyone that was doing that dampening now lies dead.

Eventually they would find a way to clear that control over them and let the true history of Xeron come to past, perhaps joining the humans in space who had fought alongside them, Ksena glanced at Kirk, him and Steel still seemed like a strange combo Ksena giggled they would both have a very interesting life, moving her hand down over her stomach, Ksena could feel the new life within herself, Alcuin wrapped his around her, one going over her on her stomach
Do you think there will be any issue with out child, I wasn’t like you, Ksena blushed and cut him off, its fine we are the same even if our appearance was different
Alcuin nodded and hugged the both of them tightly

Most of the city inhabitants don't know whats happened, I should start visiting them and explaining, perhaps if they saw me they might be willing to talk first, we want to avoid any unnecessary engagements, Kirk have the humans pulled back? Kirk nodded Yes, they are preparing to leave soon and give the good news back to earth.
Already Ksena asked, it is a long trip back and allot of the guys are homesick
Are you planning on staying? Ksena asked with a glance at Estele, I am I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys, I will be back, moving his hand around Estele waist and pulling her close, Estele has already spoken to the general about visiting earth as a spokesperson for your people, if that's alright
Ksena smiled at the news while Estele blushed, that's more fine I wouldn’t trust anyone else to be out first real contact

What plans do you have going forward after this, Kirk asked Ksena and Alcuin
A long holiday I think Alcuin replied, we have been on the road for over a year, I want to spend some time back with my tribe, although they barely recognize me now.
Kirk chucked at that, Alcuin appreance did change rather drastically and lucky it did
Ksena nodded along with it, Ill be spending some time with my family as well and helping the city recover, I think allot of things will be changing, we are still discussing about the ascension ritual, it will be hard to consider ourself as one race for quite awhile on both sides, we expect that even when people are offered the chance to ascend they will hold out, so this is going to take a bit of work, one day I would like if we all ascended, not because of the power but as our natural path of evolution

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

Before first light, Ksena burned the old route sheet and kept only the stripped sequence in her pocket: entry, objective, exit. Alcuin watched it curl into ash and said nothing. They had reached the point where less information was safer than more.

At first light, they burned the last open route sheet and kept only coded marks in separate pockets. No single loss would break the whole plan now. Ksena looked at each of them in turn and said, "From here, we protect sequence before emotion." Neither man argued. They packed in silence and stepped into the dark before sunrise.

They left with no speeches, only timing, and that restraint felt stronger than any vow.
