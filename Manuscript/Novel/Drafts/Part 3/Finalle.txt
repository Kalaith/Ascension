The barrier was now down, and sunlight shone down on the war ravished city, Ksena felt her heart ache at seeing it like this, it had been necessary but so much lost and for people like the elders, her sister wanting power, now there gone, while the towns inhabitants would still be open to tampering everyone that was doing that dampening now lies dead.

Eventually they would find a way to clear that control over them and let the true history of Xeron come to past, perhaps joining the humans in space who had fought alongside them, Ksena glanced at Kirk, him and Steel still seemed like a strange combo Ksena giggled they would both have a very interesting life, moving her hand down over her stomach, Ksena could feel the new life within herself, Alcuin wrapped his around her, one going over her on her stomach
Do you think there will be any issue with out child, I wasn’t like you, Ksena blushed and cut him off, its fine we are the same even if our appearance was different
Alcuin nodded and hugged the both of them tightly

Most of the city inhabitants don't know whats happened, I should start visiting them and explaining, perhaps if they saw me they might be willing to talk first, we want to avoid any unnecessary engagements, Kirk have the humans pulled back? Kirk nodded Yes, they are preparing to leave soon and give the good news back to earth.
Already Ksena asked, it is a long trip back and allot of the guys are homesick
Are you planning on staying? Ksena asked with a glance at Estele, I am I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys, I will be back, moving his hand around Estele waist and pulling her close, Estele has already spoken to the general about visiting earth as a spokesperson for your people, if that's alright
Ksena smiled at the news while Estele blushed, that's more fine I wouldn’t trust anyone else to be out first real contact

What plans do you have going forward after this, Kirk asked Ksena and Alcuin
A long holiday I think Alcuin replied, we have been on the road for over a year, I want to spend some time back with my tribe, although they barely recognize me now.
Kirk chucked at that, Alcuin appreance did change rather drastically and lucky it did
Ksena nodded along with it, Ill be spending some time with my family as well and helping the city recover, I think allot of things will be changing, we are still discussing about the ascension ritual, it will be hard to consider ourself as one race for quite awhile on both sides, we expect that even when people are offered the chance to ascend they will hold out, so this is going to take a bit of work, one day I would like if we all ascended, not because of the power but as our natural path of evolution

 Some wounds demanded action, but acting at the wrong time could destroy everything they had built. Ksena began stopping herself before rushing the most painful target. Alcuin stopped assuming delay was cowardice. Kirk stopped pushing for clean mission closure and started backing phased goals instead. The team did not become calm. They became deliberate, and that was better.

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

 Ksena still carried anger toward the city, Alcuin still carried doubt about what they were becoming, and Kirk still carried mission pressure from a world that expected clean answers. None of those burdens were solved in one night. But they started speaking about them before the next march, which prevented silent fractures later. In a campaign built on partial trust, honest discomfort was more useful than polite silence.

 At first they were surviving exile. Now they were shaping a response to systems that had lasted for generations. That required more than courage. It required evidence, timing, and enough allies to hold the line when retaliation came. Every conversation with locals, every recovered record, every successful withdrawal without losses moved them one step closer to that threshold. 

 They had enough proof to challenge old narratives, enough power to defend themselves in a limited fight, and enough scars to avoid easy traps. That was not victory. It was readiness. The next chapter would demand more from all of them, but they entered it with clearer roles and fewer fantasies. 

 They listed what was confirmed, what was likely, and what was still dangerous guesswork. Then they decided the next movement window and who carried what risk. That process kept arguments from expanding into paralysis. When tensions flared, they redirected to tasks: perimeter checks, route sketches, ration control, and fallback markers. It was not heroic, but it kept people alive. 

 Missed signals, unclear hand marks, and assumptions about who had visual contact were all corrected. They standardized spacing by terrain type and set new no-call rules during high-risk crossings. Small improvements like that prevented cascading mistakes later. It was unglamorous work, but it turned chaos into repeatable movement, and repeatable movement meant survivability.

 Open ground meant speed but exposure. Broken ridges meant concealment but fatigue. Old roads meant faster travel but predictable ambush points. They adjusted route selection based on weather and patrol rhythm, not pride. If the safer line cost half a day, they paid it. If a village contact looked compromised, they cut communication and moved. Hard choices stopped feeling exceptional. They became the baseline rhythm of moving through contested territory.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.
