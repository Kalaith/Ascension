Ksena grandmother had finally gathered enough of her strength back, that it was time to start training, ahead of her was Ksena and Alcuin, as well as Estele and young guy from the village, and the ascendant from this power, she really wished they had more people but there was still a lot of distrust

So this would have to do for now, it was better nothing really with the different in age between these fresh youngsters and the city inhabitants they would need an army 10 times larger, this would be focused on targeted strikes, while they are still need they did have an advantage over a lot of the other ascendant, the crystal did as much to reduce the powers, only the elders who never used the crystal would be equal on 1 on 1 battle, but that's why they are gathered now, she would drill younglings in the basics of fighting with their powers so they can make the most use out of them, she still worried, Ksena father was powerful he was the first of the ascendant and the one that captured her, he did have to use her daughter to get her to come peacefully, but he was still much stronger, and she doubted he had been doing nothing the entire time, so if they did have to fight they would need to all fight him together, although she knew this wasn’t likely to happen, even if they could beat everyone else in the village he would still have a advantage over them

The practise was going well thought the kids where naturals in using the powers, especially Ksena I guess being born as an ascendant make her out of everyone there the only true ascendant from the moment she was born, she was also trying extremely hard, she worried about her, would she push herself to far to get back at her father, she kept a close eye on her during the training, when she felt they where all suitably exhausted she called the end of training, Ksena wanted to keep going, but her grandmother could see she was at her limit, using her own delicate condition she managed to get Ksena to take her back to her room, and from there she was able to pull her into having something to eat, being elderly had some advantages and if it meant helping her look after her granddaughter she would take advantage of it

The rest where easy, only alcuin struggled to stop as well, but he would also see Ksena condition, even if she was stronger in pure ascension terms, everyone else body was more conditioned for long term exercise, but if he kept going she would do so he recluntly stopped for now and tok a breath with the rest of them

These powers were harder tocontrol he first expected, coating himself in flames was nearly natural, but pulling and using the power kinda meant telling your body cell by cell what you want to happen, the power would act sluggishly, which is why Ksena likely found it easier, even if not awakened her body was still second nature to her

For Ksena the training felt like finally getting to move a muscle she has alywas had, the power would burn through her fleames and it felt so right to her, she barly noticed when her grandmother wanted to stop, but as her concertration was broken, she nearly fel like she would collapse from the strain, she felt a bit better that everyone else seemed to be in a simliar condition, she had protecred to stoppping, but it was more out of insticy anything else, she didn’t think she could light a match right now

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

Grandmother made them run one last drill after sunset with no spoken commands, only hand marks and timing. They completed it with one stumble and no panic ignition. For the first time all week, she looked satisfied.

Grandmother ended the final drill by ordering silence and pointing each recruit to a different position in darkness. No names, no voice calls, only hand marks and discipline. They held formation through the whole sequence with one stumble and no panic ignition. For the first time all week, she allowed herself to say, "Good. Keep that standard."
