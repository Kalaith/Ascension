The human ship was nothing like the city, there was allot of metal and flashing lights, compared to the city it looked unrefined, not polished, much like the humans that were escorting her and Alcuin, Kirk traveled with them as well, the other crew members stepped aside to let them pass, there eyes roaming all over the two aliens on board the ship, they had been sent on this grandiose mission, rescue aliens in distress, but to see them live in person was something else, the guards escorted them past a set of doors, inside was just a small room in which they all stepped inside, Ksena felt the floor move, as the elevator took them to the commands office floor, Alcuin gripped the rails in the room, his fingers taught, which actually relaxed Ksena stress, they where not prisoners here, at least not yet, Kirk had said their commander wanted to meet them and see what offer they could provide, Ksena was torn on what to talk about, the current problem was between her and her people, did she really want another party coming in, Alcuin was kinda related but these humans
The elevator stopped and the door opened, the area beyond looked nicer before, allot of the machinery had been hidden by facades, this was likely the place for the commander and offerings or guests, the guards guided them out the elevator to another set of doors, the staff inside had been waiting for them, when the doors opened the command was sitting down at the end of a long table, at the arrival of his guests he got up to meet them
The general looked older Kirk, his hair was white she Ksena assumed was some form of age, he also had a bear, his face partially hidden, he was slightly short, at least shorter she expected, not as short as Kirk
The general surveyed her back into, and Alcuin as well, this was his first face to face meeting as well, the ‘aliens’ where not quite what he was expecting, although he was still not sure what he expected
The general lent in to handshake Ksena, Kirk had warned her about the custom, so she offered up her hand still a little unsure of what to do to, he shook Alcuin's hand that was a bit calmer now having seen Ksena do it first, the general noted that Alcuin had a strong grip on him
Thank you for coming you too, I am sure Kirk has gone over why we are here, but I just wanted to go over it formally with you.
We where sent here by the united nations after we received a distress call coming from your planet, this ship was especially built just to come here, it was long journey and it took us around 6 years to make the journey, we are still not sure how we can help, but my orders from earth was to do everything in my power to make sure our first contact was peaceful and build relationships between our species, From what Kirk has told me, it seems our initial rescue mission was finished long before we left from my understanding your forefathers found a way to overcome the enemy

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

The delegate who had resisted hardest asked Ksena one final question at the door: 'If this goes bad, do you stay or run?' Ksena answered without pause. 'I stay long enough to get your families out.' He did not smile, but he nodded, and that was the agreement.

When the room thinned, one elder stayed behind and asked Ksena if she would still come back if negotiations failed. Ksena did not soften the answer. "I come back if civilians are still in the line of fire." The elder studied her for a long moment, then slid a sealed route note across the table. It was the first true concession of the night.

When the doors opened, they stepped out with one fragile agreement and one usable corridor.
