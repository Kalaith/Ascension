Ksena set both palms on the table and stared at grandmother. The wood was rough, unfinished pine, starkly different from the polished obsidian surfaces of the High Council chambers. Here, in the safehouse, everything felt temporary. The air smelled of damp earth and unwashed wool, a stark reminder that they were no longer guests of the City, but fugitives hiding in its shadow.

"If you knew this would happen," Ksena said, her voice tight, "why did no one restart this sooner? Why wait until we were already burning?"

Grandmother did not look away. She sat perfectly still, her hands resting on the head of her cane. In the dim light of the oil lamp, the deep lines of her face looked like valleys carved by a long, slow river.

"Because I could not act through unascended intermediaries without exposing the network," she said, her voice dry as old parchment. "Temple interfaces require ascendant signatures. The lattice is not just a lock; it is a listener. It hears intent. Until you arrived half-awakened, there was no entry point."

Alcuin frowned, leaning against the doorframe. He was cleaning his knife, a nervous habit he had picked up in the last week. The scraping sound of steel on stone punctuated the silence. "Then what happened to me at the temple?"

"The original method required hundreds in synchronized prayer lines," grandmother said. "Residual charge compensated for low numbers. Ksena's incomplete ascension acted as catalyst, and you met compatibility thresholds."

"Compatibility?" Alcuin stopped scraping. He looked up, his eyes narrowing.

"Not blood purity," grandmother said sharply. "Conduct under pressure. You protected, adapted, and kept making choices when fear would have been easier."

She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a small, hexagonal crystal. It wasn't clear like the City gems; it was cloudy, filled with swirling inclusions of iron and gold. She set it on the table between them.

"Watch."

She tapped the crystal.

It didn't glow. It hummed. A low, resonant vibration that Ksena felt in her teeth. Then, the air above the table shimmered. Light bent and twisted, forming a three-dimensional image. It was grainy, like a memory half-forgotten, but the shapes were distinct.

A plaza. Not the ruin they knew, but a vibrant, open space filled with people. No walls. No gates. Men and women in simple tunics moved through the crowd, some glowing with faint inner light, others helping them. They were building something—a tower, but not of stone. Of light.

"The First City," Grandmother whispered. "Before the walls."

The scene shifted. A man in golden armor stood on a podium. He raised a hand, and the light in the tower turned red. The people in the crowd fell to their knees, clutching their heads.

"The Architect," Ksena recognized the armor. "Grandfather."

"He didn't build the city," Grandmother said, her eyes fixed on the phantom image. "He captured it. He found a way to invert the flow, to turn a cooperative grid into a command hierarchy. He told us it was necessary for survival. He told us the wild magic would consume us if we didn't bind it."

The image flickered. The people on their knees were now in chains—not of iron, but of red light.

"Worthiness was never about blood purity," Grandmother said, tapping the crystal again. The image vanished. "It was about discipline under pressure. Your elders rewrote that into obedience because obedience is easier to govern."

Alcuin stared at the empty space where the image had been. He looked sick. "Then everything in the city... every ritual, every prayer..."

"Is built on theft," Ksena finished for him. She felt a cold weight settle in her stomach. It wasn't surprise. It was the heavy, dull realization that the betrayal went back centuries.

"Yes," Grandmother said. "And theft survives by forcing everyone else to defend it."

Kirk, who had been listening from the shadows, stepped forward. "We can't just know this," he said. "We have to weaponize it. If the people in the districts knew their gods were just jailers..."

"They would riot," Alcuin said. "And the City Guard would slaughter them."

"Not if we organize them first," Ksena said. She looked at the crystal tablet Grandmother had placed on the table earlier. "This needs to go out. Tonight."

Kirk requested copies immediately, then suggested a distribution protocol that assumed interception. They split the record into fragments and assigned each courier only one section, with assembly instructions held by three separate contacts in different regions.

"We need runners," Alcuin said. "People we trust. Not just to carry a message, but to die rather than give it up."

The selection process was brutal.

They gathered in the cellar of the safehouse an hour later. Twelve candidates stood in a line—mostly young, all tired, their clothes stained with the dust of the lower districts. Alcuin walked down the line, looking each of them in the eye. He didn't ask them if they were brave. He asked them if they were afraid.

"You," he stopped in front of a girl no older than sixteen. She was shaking. "Why are you here?"

"My brother was taken to the Tower last year," she whispered. "He never came back."

"If you get caught with this," Alcuin held up a wax-sealed packet, "you won't come back either. You understand that?"

She stopped shaking. She looked at the packet, then at him. "Give it to me."

Alcuin nodded and handed it to her. He moved to the next.

A burly man with a scar running down his cheek. "I can run fast," he said before Alcuin could ask.

"Fast isn't enough," Alcuin said. "Can you be invisible? Can you sit in a ditch for three days without moving while a patrol walks past you?"

The man hesitated. "I... I can try."

"Trying gets you killed," Alcuin said quietly. "Go home. Guard your family. That's a fight too."

The man looked crushed, but he nodded and left.

By midnight, they had chosen five couriers. The first two were already gone, slipping into the darkness of the tunnels like ghosts.

Alcuin remained by the doorway, watching the empty street. The rain had started, a cold drizzle that turned the dust to slick mud.

"If this reaches people," he said, "they will ask why we waited so long."

Ksena tied the last wax seal herself. The hot wax burned her thumb, but she welcomed the pain. It felt real. "Then we tell them the truth. We were running, then learning, then surviving. Now we are choosing."

Grandmother touched her wrist, a brief pressure that carried apology and pride in equal measure. Her hand was cold, her skin like papyrus.

"Truth does not arrive clean," she said. "It arrives contested. Prepare for that."

Ksena looked at the remaining packets stacked on the table. Each one was a bomb, designed to blow apart a lie three hundred years old. Revelation would not end the conflict. It would begin the next one, on ground where lies no longer held the center.

"If we are going to contest it," Alcuin said, turning back to the room. He wiped his hands on his tunic, as if trying to scrub away the doubt. "We need to know what we are doing. I pulled fire from a stone by accident. Next time I might just burn myself. Or worse, burn the people I'm trying to save."

Grandmother picked up her cane. She stood slowly, her joints popping in the quiet room. She looked at the two of them—tired, dirty, barely standing, but finally on solid ground.

"You will burn yourself," she promised. There was no comfort in her voice, only the hard steel of experience. "But you will learn why. And you will learn to like the heat."

She pointed to the door that led to the sleeping quarters.

"Sleep now. Tomorrow, we stop running. Tomorrow, we start the work."

Ksena looked at her hands. The power was there, humming under the skin, waiting for a command she didn't know how to give yet. It felt different now. Before, it had been a burden. Now, it felt like a tool. A dangerous, heavy, sharp tool.

She closed her fist. The hum intensified, a silent promise of violence and creation.

"Tomorrow," she agreed.

The wind howled outside, rattling the shutters. It sounded like the City screaming. Or maybe it was the world waking up.

Ksena blew out the lamp.

Darkness took the room, but the afterimage of the crystal city burned in her mind.

They had a lot of work to do.
