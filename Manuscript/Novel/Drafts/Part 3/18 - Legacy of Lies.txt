Ksena set both palms on the table and stared at grandmother.

"If you knew this would happen, why did no one restart this sooner?"

Grandmother did not look away.

"Because I could not act through unascended intermediaries without exposing the network," she said. "Temple interfaces require ascendant signatures. Until you arrived half-awakened, there was no entry point."

Alcuin frowned. "Then what happened to me at the temple?"

"The original method required hundreds in synchronized prayer lines," grandmother said. "Residual charge compensated for low numbers. Ksena's incomplete ascension acted as catalyst, and you met compatibility thresholds."

"Compatibility?"

"Not blood purity," grandmother said. "Conduct under pressure. You protected, adapted, and kept making choices when fear would have been easier."

Grandmother set the crystal tablet between them and let the silence settle before she spoke again.

"Worthiness was never about blood purity," she said. "It was about discipline under pressure. Your elders rewrote that into obedience because obedience is easier to govern."

Alcuin read the etched symbols twice, lips moving around old dialect forms he barely recognized. The tablet described ascension as a communal responsibility, not a crown. Those who rose were expected to protect the unascended, share training methods, and submit to rotating oversight. No hereditary council. No permanent ruling line.

Ksena felt sick and relieved at once. "Then everything in the city is built on theft."

"Yes," grandmother said. "And theft survives by forcing everyone else to defend it."

Kirk requested copies immediately, then suggested a distribution protocol that assumed interception. They split the record into fragments and assigned each courier only one section, with assembly instructions held by three separate contacts in different regions.

By midnight, the first two riders were already gone.

Alcuin remained by the doorway, staring into the dark. "If this reaches people," he said, "they will ask why we waited so long."

Ksena tied the last wax seal herself. "Then we tell them the truth. We were running, then learning, then surviving. Now we are choosing."

Grandmother touched her wrist, a brief pressure that carried apology and pride in equal measure. "Truth does not arrive clean," she said. "It arrives contested. Prepare for that."

Ksena looked at the remaining packets stacked on the table and nodded. Revelation would not end the conflict. It would begin the next one, on ground where lies no longer held the center.

"If we are going to contest it," Alcuin said, turning back to the room, "we need to know what we are doing. I pulled fire from a stone by accident. Next time I might just burn myself."

Grandmother picked up her cane. She looked at the two of them—tired, dirty, but finally standing on solid ground.

"You will burn yourself," she promised. "But you will learn why."

She pointed to the door.

"Sleep now. Tomorrow, we stop running. Tomorrow, we start the work."

Ksena looked at her hands. The power was there, humming under the skin, waiting for a command she didn't know how to give yet.

She closed her fist.

"Tomorrow," she agreed.
