Ksena set both palms on the table and stared at grandmother.

"If you knew this would happen, why did no one restart this sooner?"

Grandmother did not look away.

"Because I could not act through unascended intermediaries without exposing the network," she said. "Temple interfaces require ascendant signatures. Until you arrived half-awakened, there was no entry point."

Alcuin frowned. "Then what happened to me at the temple?"

"The original method required hundreds in synchronized prayer lines," grandmother said. "Residual charge compensated for low numbers. Ksena's incomplete ascension acted as catalyst, and you met compatibility thresholds."

"Compatibility?"

"Not blood purity," grandmother said. "Conduct under pressure. You protected, adapted, and kept making choices when fear would have been easier."

Grandmother set the crystal tablet between them and let the silence settle before she spoke again.

"Worthiness was never about blood purity," she said. "It was about discipline under pressure. Your elders rewrote that into obedience because obedience is easier to govern."

Alcuin read the etched symbols twice, lips moving around old dialect forms he barely recognized. The tablet described ascension as a communal responsibility, not a crown. Those who rose were expected to protect the unascended, share training methods, and submit to rotating oversight. No hereditary council. No permanent ruling line.

Ksena felt sick and relieved at once. "Then everything in the city is built on theft."

"Yes," grandmother said. "And theft survives by forcing everyone else to defend it."

Kirk requested copies immediately, then suggested a distribution protocol that assumed interception. They split the record into fragments and assigned each courier only one section, with assembly instructions held by three separate contacts in different regions.

By midnight, the first two riders were already gone.

Alcuin remained by the doorway, staring into the dark. "If this reaches people," he said, "they will ask why we waited so long."

Ksena tied the last wax seal herself. "Then we tell them the truth. We were running, then learning, then surviving. Now we are choosing."

Grandmother touched her wrist, a brief pressure that carried apology and pride in equal measure. "Truth does not arrive clean," she said. "It arrives contested. Prepare for that."

Ksena looked at the remaining packets stacked on the table and nodded. Revelation would not end the conflict. It would begin the next one, on ground where lies no longer held the center.

Grandmother started training before sunrise and ended it after dark.

"If you only perform well when rested," she told them, "you are ceremonial fighters, not survivors."

The yard held seven trainees: Ksena, Alcuin, Estele, two village volunteers, one former city guard who had broken from crystal conditioning, and a quiet teenager who had never held power output above spark-level before this week.

It was not an army.

It was what they had.

Morning block was fundamentals.

Breath cadence.

Posture under load.

Channel shaping without flare.

Grandmother walked the line with a cane in one hand and zero patience.

"Control first, output second," she repeated until everyone hated the phrase enough to remember it.

Ksena could generate raw output faster than anyone in the yard, but anger still spiked her patterns and caused instability. Alcuin held cleaner lines, especially on precision drills, but his endurance dropped in longer sequences. Estele adapted fastest in paired work, reading timing cues before most commands finished.

By midday most hands were blistered.

No one was dismissed.

Afternoon block shifted to movement and decisions.

Split formations.

Civilian shielding drills.

Controlled retreats through narrow terrain.

Contact protocols when comms failed.

"Power does not make you soldiers," grandmother said. "Choices do."

That line stayed with Ksena through the third run when she overcommitted to an offensive push and left her rear flank open. In a real fight, two civilians in the simulation would have died.

Grandmother stopped the drill and made them reset from the beginning.

No shouting.

The disappointment was worse.

After supper they ran silent coordination under moonlight. No spoken commands, only hand signs and movement markers across broken stone.

They failed twice.

On the third run they moved as one line.

Not smooth.

Sufficient.

Grandmother leaned on her cane and gave a rare, thin smile.

"Better," she said. "Not ready. Better."

Ksena wanted another hour. She also nearly collapsed when adrenaline wore off.

Grandmother saw it before she did.

"Eat," grandmother said. "Then sleep. Pride burns faster than power."

Alcuin laughed once through exhaustion and dropped onto a crate beside her.

"If she says one more wise sentence tonight," he muttered, "I am defecting to a less wise army."

Estele handed him water.

"No you are not."

"True," he said. "But I reserve the right to complain."

Before lights-out, grandmother gathered Ksena and Alcuin aside.

"Your father expects brute force and emotional mistakes," she told Ksena. "Do not give him either."

She turned to Alcuin.

"And you. Stop matching Ksena's overtraining out of loyalty reflex. You both crash, everyone dies."

Alcuin nodded, chastened.

Ksena did too.

At dawn the next day, they ran integration drills with live stressors: smoke, noise, uneven footing, and rotating command handoffs when designated leaders were removed mid-sequence.

The quiet teenager froze on first pass and nearly quit.

Ksena took her aside between rounds.

"I froze too," she said. "Do the next step, not the whole battle."

The teenager returned and finished the run.

By the end of week, output metrics were up, burn incidents were down, and cohesion scores had doubled in paired tests.

Still not enough.

But no longer fragile.

When they finally broke for the night, Ksena sat on the training wall with sore shoulders and soot streaked across her jaw.

Alcuin climbed up beside her and passed over half a ration bar.

"Think we are ready?" he asked.

Ksena looked down at trainees cleaning the yard in tired silence.

"I think we are less likely to die stupidly," she said.

Alcuin considered that.

"I will take it."

Behind them, grandmother extinguished the last training brazier and locked the gate.

Tomorrow they would do it again.

No one complained.

After the revelations, camp discipline changed overnight.

No one treated training as optional anymore.

Ksena could feel the shift in small details before dawn: fewer idle conversations, tighter gear layouts, everyone eating before drills instead of pretending they were too tense to swallow. The truth about the crystal had not made them fearless. It had made consequences concrete.

Grandmother used that mood immediately.

She split the morning into three tracks. Ksena with power regulation under emotional stress. Alcuin with command relay and fallback sequencing. The rest on synchronized movement through narrow corridors where one mistake could block an entire retreat.

"You are no longer preparing to survive one confrontation," grandmother said, pacing with her cane across the chalked drill grid. "You are preparing to survive the reaction after people hear the truth. That reaction will be messy."

Kirk joined second session with an armful of slate boards and timing strips from human operations logs. He had translated technical protocols into field-simple commands: if comms fail, use color flares; if flares fail, use mirrored light; if weather kills both, use paired runners and fixed minute marks.

Alcuin took the slate, scanned it once, and started assigning fallback pairs before anyone else moved.

"If I go down, Ksena takes route command," he said. "If Ksena goes down, Estele takes it. If both of us go down, no debate. You follow coded sheet B and extract civilians first."

No one argued.

At midday, Ksena and grandmother ran focused control drills away from the main yard.

"Again," grandmother said after Ksena overflared on the turn.

Ksena reset, drew breath, and tried to shape output instead of forcing it.

"Again."

On the fourth pass, the arc held stable.

Grandmother nodded but did not praise. "Better. Keep better when tired."

Fatigue came hard in the afternoon heat. This was the moment old habits usually broke. Grandmother knew it and deliberately pushed coordination drills into that window.

They failed first run when one recruit anticipated a command and crossed lanes too early.

They failed second run when Alcuin stayed too long to cover a hypothetical rear threat and missed extraction clock.

"You are protecting pride, not people," grandmother told him.

Third run passed.

By sunset, they had one complete cycle clean under stress.

During evening ration break, Ksena sat beside Alcuin on a broken wall and stared at hands that still felt too powerful and not powerful enough.

"Do you ever feel like we're training for ten different futures and all of them are bad?" she asked.

Alcuin gave a dry laugh. "Yes. I also think that's progress. Before, we trained for one future and pretended it was safe."

She leaned her shoulder into his and let silence hold for a minute.

Below them, Kirk and Estele marked courier routes on oilcloth maps while grandmother corrected symbol spacing with merciless precision.

For once, routine felt like relief.

Later that night, grandmother gathered core team under low lantern and made them repeat the same sentence back to her until tone matched meaning.

"We reveal truth with structure, not spectacle."

Ksena repeated it last.

This time, she believed it.
