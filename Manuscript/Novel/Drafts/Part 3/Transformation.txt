Are you sure you are upto this grandmother? Ksena asked, she looked nervous, this procedure would draw power out, and her grandmother had been sealed for along time
I am fine, do not worry about me
Okay, if you are sure, are you ready alcuin?
Alcuin nodded I think so, I wish we had some more idea on what we are doing, this is a lot different from before, are you sure it takes 3 people?
Ksena grandmother nodded, the temples had a lot of residual energy left which made up for being single ascendant, and Ksena power has wanted to be used for awhile, even if you had never found the temples I wish she would have still managed to finish her ascension ritual alone
Alcuin nodded, Ksena blushed
So what do we need to do?
Well we form a circle around estele and summon our power, estele should do her best to be relax and aborb the power
Are you ready for this? I think it will be a quick procedure, instead of Alcuins that happened over a few months
Estele nodded, I am nervous, this will be quite a diffrence
Yes, you do not have to do it
No I want too, this is our destiny, and I want to be among the first of the new generation to do it
Okay, stand in the middle and let's do this
Estele walked up facing Alcuin, as Ksena and her mother closed the circle around her
Okay just relax and close your eyes and let this happen, I will stop the ritual if its going wrong
Estele nodded, she took a deep breath and closed her eyes, this was it, if this happened her and alcuin would be equals again, although estele knew she had already lost the war, it wasn’t to be and nothing could fix that, she had defiantly considered running away back to her tribe, finding someone else and trying to forget, but learning about her species this had to be the way it will happen, she would fight alongside Alcuin and Ksena and reclaim her world that had become stagnat
Okay focus your attention towards the center, but just let the power flow, it will circle around us and get pulled bit by bit into Estele
Alcuin nodded and closed his eyes and concertrated, he knew Estele wanted him but it wasn’t to be, but he sensed that she understood this, if he didn’t he didn’t think he could go through the ritual, he didn’t want her to trace a figment of her imganation, making such a large chnage to herself because of him, he focused his attention on Estele, he could feel his power going into Ksena and her grandmother before turning and goign towards Estele, he bekep conertaining as the power went from a gentle tug to a hurricane of force pulling his power out of him
Ksena felt Alcuin ergy, while she was onncent and focused on the mission, she knew Estele had some thoughts towards Alcuin, but she trusted them both with her life, her doubts not forming any sort of barrer as her strangth flowed into estele.
Her grandmother was actually finding this harder she expected, the energy drain was more she expected, she was actually using some of her granchild to keep herself up and focusing on the Estele, this would be the future, she would not let them down like she had let her own daughter down and her neive who was crazed, she was most likely a very poliate and nice girl going into the ritual, and the ritual wanted everuone to have a ase level of combat skills as well as the ability to do what she needed to do, prehaps being shown that she would be forced to kill drove her insane, she was just gkad that Ksena didn’t fall under the same influence
Soon the power was visible even to Kirk outside as it formed around Estele, Kirk could see the power was not only moving around her but was also pushing into into her, even as Kirk watched he could see Estele body start to change before him, her skin was starting to glow, as the energy made contact with her cells, it looks like the doubts might hgave been unfrond as kirk turned his eyes as the light got brighter and Estele was soon hidden from sight, the room flashed and the 3 doing the ritual all collapsed onto the ground beneth Estele, Kirk needed a second look when she first ssaw estele, her body had changed so much she could look like a sister for Esena
Kirk rushed up, is everyone okay
Alcuin was the first to get back to his feet, that was a lot of work, Ksena was next, grandma are you okay, if I had thought it would use that much power I would not let you have done it yet
I'm fine, I am sorry I was seaked I expected, sorry to both of you, your only this tired because I had to use your own power to help support me, but it looks like it worked
Estele opened her eyes, bring up her hand infront of her face, it was so different her skin color had changed and darkened, she was now dressed in the normal ascension fires, her limbs where a lot more refined, holding her hand infront of her, Estele concertated on it, and it burst into flames, she jumped as she did it, trying to pull her fist away from the fire, but the fire didn’t go out and she realized it didn’t burn even, bringing her hand back up Estele focused and the flame grew into a roaring fire and dying down to a single flame she closed her fist around It dismissing it.

It worked, I am an ascended now!, Ksena grabbed and hugged her, we are sisters now, just like if she had both been in the city and had done our ritual together.

When are we going to do the others Kirk piped up, Ksena grandmother gave him a withering stare, after we have had a good night sleep, I would rather summon a second sun do that ritual right now
Alcuin and Ksena nodded, defaintly a nap, I am exhausted Ksena said, but I think one day will be enough
With the ritual grandma can we use more people, or is 3 the limit?
Mm I think we could try 4 but I do not think we would want to do more that
Ksena nodded
Alcuin looked over Estele, he still didn’t feel special feelings for her, but it was a bit like Ksena saying they where sisters now, he felt more like a big brother to Estele now, Estele could feel it as well when she looked at alcuin, but it didn’t stop her from making a sexy pose and winking at alcuin, he may have decided, but it didn’t mean she coudn’t tease him, he defiantly was more interested in her now since the transformation
The other person was Kirk who couldn’t seem to take his eyes of her now, Ksena had always had his attention, but she was off limits, but estele, it as obvious she wasn’t going to get her first pick.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Ksena checked the map against the ridgeline twice before giving the signal to move. Alcuin did not argue this time; he simply shifted left to cover the blind angle and waited for Kirk to confirm the rear. They moved in silence through the cut stone until the wind changed, then dropped low and held position. No patrol crossed, but they stayed down until they were sure. That caution cost them an hour and likely saved them a fight.

At camp, they no longer talked in circles. They set watch order, reviewed water levels, and marked two fallback points in case the next approach collapsed. Kirk traced likely scout paths from his field notes and handed them to Ksena without comment. She folded the sheet and slid it into oilcloth. Alcuin watched both of them and finally said what none of them had said all day: they were tired, but they were no longer improvising every step.

The hardest moments came when the road went quiet. Quiet used to feel like safety. Now it felt like an ambush waiting for shape. Ksena forced herself to keep breathing steady and count terrain exits instead of threats she could not see. Alcuin stayed close enough to pull her back if she rushed, far enough to keep both of them alive if fire came from the wrong side. They had learned that distance was not emotional. It was tactical.

By the second watch, Kirk had the flare gun across his knees and Alcuin had his spear laid within arm's reach. Ksena sat with a slate and wrote three headings: confirmed, likely, unknown. She filled each column before sleeping. When she was done, she passed it to Alcuin. He added one line under confirmed: if they fought on bad ground, they died. No one argued with that.
