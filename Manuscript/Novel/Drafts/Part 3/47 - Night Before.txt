Interlude - The Night Before

Wind scraped along the canyon wall and carried the smell of cold ash into camp. Ksena sat with her back against a supply crate, polishing dirt from a blade she almost never used now that power answered faster than steel. Across the fire, Alcuin sorted signal tags by touch in the dark, memorizing edges so he could identify each one without light.

Kirk checked the same route board three times, then erased it anyway and redrew the approach from memory. "If we lose the board," he said, "we lose paper, not sequence."

No one argued.

The mission clock on Kirk’s wrist read 22:14. Eight hours until movement.

Ksena broke the silence first. "What are we missing?"

Alcuin did not look up. "Weather shift at dawn. Wind from the east. It will carry sound farther on the south approach."

Kirk added a note. "So we shorten verbal range and switch to touch confirmation inside the final corridor."

They worked through contingencies until the list ran out: comms failure, shield delay, extraction injury, false surrender. Every scenario ended with the same instruction written at the bottom of the slate: civilians out first.

Near midnight, grandmother joined them, wrapped in a heavy cloak and moving slower than she liked to admit. She studied their board and tapped the line assigning Ksena to rear guard on exit.

"You are not invincible," grandmother said.

"I know," Ksena replied.

"Then prove it by living through this operation."

After grandmother left, Ksena stared at the fire until the coals dimmed. Alcuin slid one signal tag toward her, the one marked for retreat trigger.

"If it goes wrong, you call it," he said.

She closed her fingers around the tag. "If it goes wrong, we all leave together."

At 03:00 they geared up in silence. Kirk ran the last sync check. Alcuin tightened Ksena’s left gauntlet strap when her hands started to shake. She did the same for him.

When the signal light turned green, they stepped into the dark canyon single-file, not fearless, but decided.
