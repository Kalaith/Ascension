Interlude - The Night Before

Wind scraped along the canyon wall and carried the smell of cold ash into camp. Ksena sat with her back against a supply crate, polishing dirt from a blade she almost never used now that power answered faster than steel. Across the fire, Alcuin sorted signal tags by touch in the dark, memorizing edges so he could identify each one without light.

Kirk checked the same route board three times, then erased it anyway and redrew the approach from memory. "If we lose the board," he said, "we lose paper, not sequence."

No one argued.

The mission clock on Kirk's wrist read 22:14. Eight hours until movement.

Ksena broke the silence first. "What are we missing?"

Alcuin did not look up. "Weather shift at dawn. Wind from the east. It will carry sound farther on the south approach."

Kirk added a note. "So we shorten verbal range and switch to touch confirmation inside the final corridor."

They worked through contingencies until the list ran out: comms failure, shield delay, extraction injury, false surrender. Every scenario ended with the same instruction written at the bottom of the slate: civilians out first.

Near midnight, grandmother joined them, wrapped in a heavy cloak and moving slower than she liked to admit. She studied their board and tapped the line assigning Ksena to rear guard on exit.

"You are not invincible," grandmother said.

"I know," Ksena replied.

"Then prove it by living through this operation."

After grandmother left, Ksena stared at the fire until the coals dimmed. Alcuin slid one signal tag toward her, the one marked for retreat trigger.

"If it goes wrong, you call it," he said.

She closed her fingers around the tag. "If it goes wrong, we all leave together."

At 03:00 they geared up in silence. Kirk ran the last sync check. Alcuin tightened Ksena's left gauntlet strap when her hands started to shake. She did the same for him.

When the signal light turned green, they stepped into the dark canyon single-file, not fearless, but decided.

The extraction craft waited in a hidden cut with engines already warming.

"Belts tight," Kirk said from the cockpit. "We launch hot and low."

The bay doors opened to fire.

Kalani hit the ridge above them with two fast strikes, forcing debris into the launch lane. Kirk shoved throttle forward before the second wave landed.

Acceleration pinned everyone to their seats. Alcuin swore into his harness. Ksena tried to look back and could not move her head against the force.

A third strike passed close enough to shake the frame.

"She is reading our climb," Kirk shouted. "I need a disruption window now."

Ksena unstrapped one side, braced against the hatch frame, and forced a thermal flare into the canyon floor behind them. The false signature bloomed bright in Kalani's pursuit line.

Kalani broke right to follow it.

Kirk used the two-second gap and drove the craft through a narrow stone split, then into cloud cover.

By the time Kalani corrected, they were gone.

Alcuin dropped his head between his knees and fought vertigo while the craft leveled.

"Tell me this flight ends soon," he said.

"One hour," Kirk answered. "Try not to pass out before then."

Ksena kept eyes on instruments, jaw tight.

"She is faster than before," she said.

"Then next time we pick ground where speed is useless," Alcuin replied.

They touched down in a dry ravine with engines ticking hot and everyone shaking from adrenaline.

No one called it a win.

They had not beaten Kalani.

They had escaped.

The fleet arrived like weather turning violent.

Ksena saw the first hull break cloud and felt old fear move through her spine before thought caught up.

Then more shapes followed.

Carriers.

Heavy escorts.

Fast wedges peeling toward strategic corridors.

Within minutes the sky was no longer sky. It was occupied geometry.

Kirk lowered binoculars and did not bother softening his read.

"That is not reconnaissance," he said. "That is staging for control."

Alcuin spread a cloth map over a flat stone and anchored corners with spent casings.

"If they hold these three canyons," he said, tapping each route in turn, "lowland supply dies in two days."

Ksena forced herself to count instead of panic.

Hull spacing.

Descent vectors.

Escort pattern.

Whoever commanded the formation had studied terrain and chosen pressure points deliberately.

"Western settlements first," she said. "If passes close before warning, half the civilian population gets trapped by dusk."

Kirk keyed his headset and transmitted burst priority to orbit command.

"Captain can shadow edge lanes," he said, listening to static and delayed confirmations. "We cannot contest full orbit alone. Ground movement starts now."

Ksena nodded.

The sky above was terrifying.

The ground beneath her boots still required decisions.

She split routes in under a minute.

Alcuin to ridge clans and canyon wardens.

Kirk to aerial recon and comm relay.

Ksena to city gate command table and emergency corridor authority.

No one argued.

They moved.

At the first fork, Alcuin caught her arm.

"Do not negotiate from guilt," he said. "Negotiate from leverage."

She almost laughed at the timing.

"When did you become strategic?"

"Around the third city trying to kill us."

He ran west.

Kirk launched with two scouts and climbed toward cloud shelf where radar shadows were thin.

Ksena took the south trail at full speed.

By the time she reached the gate command table, rumors had already outrun facts.

Some argued immediate surrender to avoid bombardment.

Some demanded preemptive strikes on suspected collaborators.

Some denied fleet identity entirely and called it human deception.

Ksena waited until shouting peaked, then ignited a narrow line of flame over the center table just high enough to command silence.

"Listen," she said. "You do not need to trust me. You need to count timelines."

She outlined descent windows, pass vulnerabilities, shelter capacities, and evacuation order in hard numbers.

Panic did not vanish.

It became operational.

By nightfall, warning runners were moving west, grain convoys were redirected, and first shelter sectors were opening under mixed supervision.

Above, fleet lights shifted into lower holding patterns.

The invasion had not started yet.

It had announced itself.

On the ridge outside the gate hall, Ksena paused once and looked up at the darkened sky.

Her ancestors had faced this enemy and survived long enough to leave warnings.

This time the world they left behind was fractured, suspicious, and underprepared.

It was also not helpless.

Ksena touched the signal bead at her throat and sent one short message to both Alcuin and Kirk.

"Routes active. Civilians moving. We hold." 

Wind answered first.

Then two confirmation tones returned, one from west trail, one from cloud layer.

She turned back toward the city and kept walking.

The enemy had arrived in force.

This time they would meet a world that remembered and adapted.

Ksena did not hear their command channel, but she felt the timing shift in the sky.

Holding patterns tightened.

Escort wedges widened.

Targeting geometry settled into intent.

She sent one more message, this time to every route captain on the emergency net.

"Phase two is coming. Keep columns moving. Do not cluster. If one path closes, take the next marker and keep going."

Acknowledgments returned in uneven bursts from hills, streets, and tunnel mouths.

It was messy.

It was enough.
