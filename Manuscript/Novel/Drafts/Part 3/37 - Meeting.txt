The human ship was nothing like the city, there was allot of metal and flashing lights, compared to the city it looked unrefined, not polished, much like the humans that we're escorting her and Alcuin, Kirk traveled with them as we'll, the other crew members stepped aside to let them pass, there eyes roaming all over the two aliens on board the ship, they had been sent on this grandiose mission, rescue aliens in distress, but to see them live in person was something else, the guards escorted them past a set of doors, inside was just a small room in which they all stepped inside, Ksena felt the floor move, as the elevator took them to the commands office floor, Alcuin gripped the rails in the room, his fingers taught, which actually relaxed Ksena stress, they where not prisoners here, at least not yet, Kirk had said their commander wanted to meet them and see what offer they could provide, Ksena was torn on what to talk about, the current problem was between her and her people, did she really want another party coming in, Alcuin was kinda related but these humans

The elevator stopped and the door opened, the area beyond looked nicer before, allot of the machinery had been hidden by facades, this was likely the place for the commander and offerings or guests, the guards guided them out the elevator to another set of doors, the staff inside had been waiting for them, when the doors opened the command was sitting down at the end of a long table, at the arrival of his guests he got up to meet them

The general looked older Kirk, his hair was white she Ksena assumed was some form of age, he also had a bear, his face partially hidden, he was slightly short, at least shorter she expected, not as short as Kirk

The general surveyed her back into, and Alcuin as we'll, this was his first face to face meeting as we'll, the ‘aliens’ where not quite what he was expecting, although he was still not sure what he expected

The general lent in to handshake Ksena, Kirk had warned her about the custom, so she offered up her hand still a little unsure of what to do to, he shook Alcuin's hand that was a bit calmer now having seen Ksena do it first, the general noted that Alcuin had a strong grip on him

Thank you for coming you too, I am sure Kirk has gone over why we are here, but I just wanted to go over it formally with you.

We where sent here by the united nations after we received a distress call coming from your planet, this ship was especially built just to come here, it was long journey and it took us around 6 years to make the journey, we are still not sure how we can help, but my orders from earth was to do everything in my power to make sure our first contact was peaceful and build relationships between our species, From what Kirk has told me, it seems our initial rescue mission was finished long before we left from my understanding your forefathers found a way to overcome the enemy

The first-contact chamber stayed tense long after the formal greetings ended.

Ksena sat between the city delegates and the human command table, translating not only words but assumptions. When Captain Hale said "peaceful framework," one elder heard "occupation." When an elder said "ancestral obligation," Hale heard "religious veto." Kirk spent half the session rewriting phrasing before either side could take offense.

By the second hour, progress came in narrow increments. The humans agreed to no unilateral patrols inside settlement zones. The city council agreed to establish a shared incident channel so rumors would not become retaliatory strikes. It was fragile, procedural, and exactly what they needed.

Then one delegate asked the question everyone had avoided. "If your world is six years away," he said to Hale, "what prevents you from taking what you want and leaving us with promises?"

Hale answered without theatrics. "Because we cannot build a stable route through this sector without local cooperation, and because every mission log from this expedition is reviewed by civilian oversight on Earth. We are accountable whether we like it or not."

The delegate did not smile, but he nodded once.

When the meeting finally broke, Ksena remained behind with two elders to draft the first joint statement. It would not erase fear, but it would establish a record: no side had consented to domination, and both had consented to rules.

Outside the chamber, Alcuin waited in the corridor, hand resting near the hilt he no longer needed but still carried. "Did we get anything real?" he asked.

Ksena held up the signed page. "Not trust," she said. "Structure. It is enough for tonight."
