The shield had divided the world for so long people treated it like weather.

Permanent. Untouchable. Natural.

Ksena knew better.

She and Alcuin crossed into the city at pre-dawn through old maintenance lanes she had used as a child when sneaking beyond formal patrol routes. Full ascension let them slip through sensor logic that had once flagged her exile signature instantly.

Even now, moving fast through polished corridors and sculpted gardens, Alcuin looked at everything with wary disbelief.

"Your city shines while villages starve," he said under his breath.

"I know," Ksena answered. "Keep moving."

The ritual district sat at the city center under layered guard patterns. Ceremonial presence was high. Practical scrutiny lower than it should have been.

They entered during shift transition and cleared the first hall without contact.

Inside the main chamber they both felt it at once.

A low pulse, like a heartbeat under stone.

The pedestal that held the ritual crystal was hidden below floor level when dormant. Ksena found the wall trigger by memory and blind luck, pressing one recessed plate until hidden mechanisms groaned alive.

The pedestal rose.

The crystal emerged in a ring cradle, red-white and bright enough to cast hard shadows.

Alcuin exhaled. "That thing runs the barrier?"

"And the ritual," Ksena said. "Maybe both through the same lattice."

She reached for it.

The moment skin met crystal, images broke across her mind in violent sequence.

First shield activation.

Ascendants in lines feeding output into a planetary shell.

Then hidden protocols beneath the official design.

Selective drain rates.

Lineage filters.

Male conduits stripped harder than female channels unless tagged by founding bloodlines.

It was not error.

It was policy.

Ksena staggered.

Alcuin caught her elbow before she fell.

"What did you see?"

"A control system pretending to be protection," she said, voice thin with shock. "They built succession into the barrier itself."

She wrapped the crystal in insulated cloth before lifting it free.

Alarm did not trigger immediately.

They exited through service corridors and reached the outer rendezvous at first light where Kirk and grandmother waited in an abandoned relay vault.

Kirk set three recording probes around the crystal while grandmother unpacked old glyph plates and began cross-reference translation.

"Can we destroy it?" Alcuin asked.

Grandmother's answer was immediate.

"Not safely. This matrix stores centuries of accumulated charge. If it ruptures uncontrolled, we could trigger continental discharge."

Kirk overlaid her translation with shield harmonic models.

"You might not need destruction," he said. "You need rewiring."

Grandmother tapped a glyph ring.

"This node controls discriminatory draw and command imprint. If we rewrite phase key at core interval, we can sever control logic without collapsing the barrier shell."

"Window?" Ksena asked.

Kirk ran timing simulation twice.

"Four seconds per cycle," he said. "Three synchronized operators. Miss timing and seam closure will liquefy whatever is inside the channel."

No one spoke for several beats.

Then Alcuin looked at Ksena and said the obvious.

"We train for four seconds."

The next week was nothing but repetition.

Breath control under load.

Output matching drills.

Failure abort timing.

Entry and extraction paths run blind until each movement felt like reflex.

Ksena hated the crystal and slept with it within reach.

Every time she touched it she felt the old command pressure trying to creep into intent.

Every time she pulled back before it found a grip.

On final rehearsal night, grandmother stood over the timing board and watched the three of them run one last dry cycle.

"Again," she said.

They did it again.

When they finally hit perfect lock transfer three runs in a row, Kirk shut down the projection and leaned both hands on the table.

"This is the best we are getting," he said.

Ksena stared at the wrapped crystal in the center tray.

"Then we go tomorrow," she said.

No one argued.
