The shield was the biggest thing that separated the two species from each other, they couldn’t break it, and the other group didn’t want to leave it, it coming down was the only way, Ksena had crept in past the wall with Alcuin, since they where both full ascendant, unlike when Ksena was exiled, they where able to slip in without any warning going up, using all the old routes from when she use to visit the tribe outside, Ksena guided the slack jawed Alcuin through the winding city, the other city was nearly as impressive, but not quite this city was maintained better with the cultured gardens and polished floors, to Alcuin it was like wondering through a jewel
Ksena only had a hint of where the barrier could be, the barrier was setup early when the city was first established, and it actually did two things, it protected the city, but Ksena also believed it was part of the Ascension ritual, so that's where they would start the hunt, the ritual was held in the center of the city and was heavily guarded by ascendants, as we'll as all the other city residents, Ksena had to move fast to avoid detection, nearly dragging Alcuin along with her, lucky for them, while it was guarded, it was still mostly ceremonial, so while guards where around the ritual site, inside it should be empty, people only entered when doing the ritual
After finally entering the building, Ksena and Alcuin both felt it, like a heartbeat of energy, Ksena smiled to herself, she was right, it had to be here, it made the most sense, they separated to explore the room, although it felt like Ksena was doing most of the looking, Alcuin was still a bit overwhelmed, but she had been here for the ritual, in the center of the room during the ritual there was a pedestal which held the crystal they used, currently the floor laid flat, so there must be a way of triggering the pedestal to show, it didn’t make sense on the floor, so Ksena went to the far wall from the door and ran her fingers over the wall, searching for any sort of trigger, she felt it depress and heard the pedestal start to raise, Alcuin jumped when it happened, as the pedestal rose until the top hit the ceiling, in the center was the jewel, this was used for the ritual, was it also used for powering the portal..prehaps the crystal acted allot like Alcuin did at the ceremony, it drew powers from her and into Alcuin, perhaps this crystal used the power for each new ascendant to power the portal, and by triggering the power to move through there body it awoke their latent ascendant powers, Alcuin and Ksena approached it from either side of the pedestal, Ksena didn’t know if it was safe to touch or not.. But they where here for this crystal, perhaps if they took it away, it would both take down the barrier, and stop further ascendant from being controlled, they didn’t have any choice
Ksena reached in and grabbed the crystal, this time the images flashed in her mind, but she could control them, outside of these images, she could feel it tugging at her power, as we'll as trying to creep into her, the control mechanism.
The images showed allot more now, they showed the barrier first being created, and Ksena also felt the energy of every ascendant who had also given it power, in this case one thing it showed her was that males where treated differently, it didn’t just pull there energy, it yanked it viciously from there bodies, Ksena couldn’t understand why it would do this, why restrict who can be ascended, but the following images showed her, the elders wanted to maintain control over all children born, males coming from the original forefathers where protected from the spell, but from other lineages the powers where lost and the people where just treated as slaves for breeding more ascendant, without there knowledge, this crystal was evil Ksena felt, she wanted to shatter it now in her arms, but who knew how much power it contained, if it could create such a strong barrier, it must have allot of power, it would have to be researched carefully.

The crystal hummed in Ksena’s hands like a living thing, cold at first, then steadily warm as she matched breathing to its pulse.

When she opened herself to it, images spilled through her in abrupt, painful flashes: the first shield ignition, lines of ascendants feeding power into the lattice, and then the hidden protocol layered beneath it, siphoning male conduits at higher rates to keep succession tightly controlled. It was not a flaw. It was design.

She nearly dropped the crystal.

Alcuin caught her elbow. "What did you see?"

"A cage built from our own ritual," she said, voice shaking. "They called it protection."

Kirk set recording probes around the chamber while grandmother cross-referenced the glyph rings carved into the pedestal. The shield itself could not be destroyed safely without risking a planet-wide discharge, but its discriminatory draw could be interrupted by rewriting the phase key at the central node.

"Meaning?" Kirk asked.

Grandmother answered. "Meaning we can break the control without dropping the barrier. If we reach the core."

They ran the insertion math until dawn. The opening window was less than four seconds every cycle, and only if three operators synced power at precise intervals. Miss it, and the seam closed hard enough to atomize exposed tissue.

Ksena steadied her breathing and looked at the crystal one more time. She hated what it had done. She also needed what it could still do. "Then we train for four seconds," she said.

No one argued.
