The preparation for the first true ascension was not sterile. It was messy. It was visceral.

There were no white robes. No polished crystal beds. No chanting priests.

There was mud. There was blood. There were rocks arranged in a circle on the floor of a cave they called "Safehouse 4" because 1, 2, and 3 had been compromised.

Ksena watched Grandmother crush dried herbs into a paste using a mortar and pestle. The smell was pungent—sage, sulfur, and something metallic.

"It needs a conduit," Grandmother muttered, adding a drop of oil to the mixture. "The body resists the change. The mind rejects it. We have to trick both into opening the door."

She walked around the circle, painting symbols on the stone floor with the paste. The lines were jagged, wet, and dark in the firelight.

"Anchor points here, here, and here," Grandmother pointed. "Receiver in the center. Do not break the circle."

Estele stood in the middle. She looked small against the rough stone walls. She wasn't wearing armor. She wore a simple tunic, stained with travel dust. Her hands were clenched at her sides, knuckles white.

"Are you scared?" Alcuin asked. He was checking the perimeter again, pacing like a caged animal.

"Terrified," Estele admitted. She forced a laugh, but it came out brittle. "But I'm more scared of staying useless."

"You aren't useless," Ksena said quickly.

"I am unascended," Estele corrected. "In this war, that means hostage or victim. I choose neither."

Grandmother stood up, dusting off her hands. "Enough talk. The planetary alignment is weak, but the ley line under this mountain is strong. It will have to do."

She checked the charcoal lines one last time.

"This isn't clean magic," she warned, looking at the three of them—Ksena, Alcuin, and herself. The anchors. "We are not powering her directly. We are opening the door. She has to walk through it. And the door... it fights back."

They took their places.

Ksena sat cross-legged at the northern point. The stone was cold under her legs. She closed her eyes and reached for the warmth. Not the angry fire of combat, but the deep, steady pulse she had learned to find in the training yard.

"Begin," Grandmother whispered.

Ksena pushed the power outward. She felt for Alcuin's jagged, heavy energy on her left—dense as granite. She felt Grandmother's immense, silent ocean on her right.

They connected.

The circle snapped shut.

The air in the cave changed instantly. Pressure dropped. The smell of ozone filled the space, masking the scent of the herbs. The painted lines on the floor began to hiss, then glow with a faint, violet light.

"Hold it!" Grandmother barked as the energy spiked.

Ksena gritted her teeth. It felt heavy. Like holding up a collapsing ceiling. The power wasn't flowing *through* the circle; it was pressing *down* on it.

In the center, Estele gasped. She fell to her knees, clutching her chest.

"It burns!" she cried out. Her voice was thin, panic edging into the words.

"Let it in!" Grandmother shouted over the rising hum of power. "Do not fight the heat! Become the heat! If you fight it, it will cook you!"

Estele tried. Ksena could see her fighting the instinct to curl up and hide. She forced her back straight. She opened her arms.

From Ksena's perspective, it looked like Estele was being unraveled. The violet light didn't just surround her; it sank into her. It looked painful. Intruder. Invasion.

The light surged. It wrapped around her legs, climbed her torso, and engulfed her head.

Estele screamed. It wasn't a scream of fear anymore. It was a scream of biology being rewritten.

"More power!" Grandmother ordered. "She's stalling! Push!"

Ksena poured everything she had into the link. She felt Alcuin do the same, the ground shaking beneath them as he grounded the excess charge.

For a moment, there was silence. Absolute, ringing silence.

Then the cave exploded with light.

Ksena was thrown backward into the wall. She hit hard, potential ribs cracking, her vision swimming with spots.

"Estele!"

Smoke filled the room. The smell of scorched rock was overpowering.

Ksena coughed, waving the smoke away. "Alcuin? Grandmother?"

"Here," Alcuin rasped from the darkness.

In the center of the circle, the dust was settling.

A figure stood there.

Estele.

She was glowing. Literally glowing. Veins of silver light traced patterns under her skin, fading slowly as she breathed. Her clothes were singed, but her skin looked... polished. New.

Her eyes were open, and the irises were no longer brown. They were molten gold.

She looked at her hands. She flexed her fingers. Sparks danced between them, unbidden but controlled.

"Oh," she whispered. Her voice sounded different. Resonant. Like two people speaking at once.

Ksena scrambled to her feet, wincing at the pain in her side. "Are you... are you okay?"

Estele looked at her. A slow smile spread across her face. It was the same smile Ksena had known for years, but the teeth seemed sharper.

"I feel..." Estele tilted her head back. "Everything."

She raised a hand. The campfire in the corner flared up, turning from red to blue to white, obeying her silent command. The flames danced, forming shapes—a bird, a tower, a face.

"I can feel the wood burning," Estele said, staring at the fire. "I can feel the air feeding it. It's not magic. It's conversation."

She reached out to touch the stone wall.

"Don't!" Grandmother warned.

Too late.

Estele's fingers brushed the rock. The stone glowed red instantly, melting under her touch like wax. She pulled her hand back, startled.

"Careful," Grandmother said, leaning on her cane. She looked exhausted, her face gray. "You are a furnace with the door open. You have to learn to shut it."

Estele looked at the molten print on the wall. Fear flickered in her golden eyes. "I didn't mean to..."

"You didn't mean to because you haven't learned the language yet," Grandmother said. "You were shouting."

"Welcome to the conversation," she added dryly. "Try not to burn the house down while you learn the words."

Alcuin brushed dirt off his knees, staring at Estele with wide eyes.

"That," he said, "was terrifying."

Estele laughed. The sound was bright and clear, but it carried a static charge that made the hair on Ksena's arms stand up.

"Yes," she agreed. "Let's do it again."

"Not today," Grandmother said firmly. "The line needs to recharge. And so do you. Your body isn't used to carrying a sun inside its chest."

Estele nodded, the glow fading entirely now, leaving her looking human again. Just a girl in a dirty tunic. But the air around her still shivered with heat.

Ksena walked over and put a hand on Estele's shoulder. The skin was hot to the touch, like a fever.

"You did it," Ksena whispered.

"We did it," Estele corrected. She looked at the smoldering circle on the floor.

The line had been crossed. The monopoly was broken.

They had made a god in a cave.

And if they could make one...

Ksena looked at Alcuin.

They could make an army.

But looking at the molten rock on the wall, and the exhaustion etched into Grandmother's face, Ksena knew the cost would be high.

"Rest," Ksena said. "Tomorrow we start teaching you how not to melt the world."

Estele smiled, but her eyes remained gold, alien and ancient in the firelight.

"I don't think I want to stop melting it," she said softly. "I think I want to forge it."
