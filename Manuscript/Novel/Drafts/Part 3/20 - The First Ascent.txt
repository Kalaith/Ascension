The preparation for the first true ascension was not sterile. It was messy.

There were no white robes. No polished crystal beds. No chanting priests.

There was mud. There was blood. There were rocks arranged in a circle on the floor of a cave they called "Safehouse 4" because 1, 2, and 3 had been compromised.

Ksena watched Grandmother trace lines in the dirt with a piece of charcoal.

"Anchor points here, here, and here," Grandmother muttered. "Receiver in the center. Do not break the circle."

Estele stood in the middle. She looked small against the rough stone walls. She wasn't wearing armor. She wore a simple tunic, stained with travel dust. Her hands were clenched at her sides.

"Are you scared?" Alcuin asked.

"Terrified," Estele admitted. "But I'm more scared of staying useless."

"You aren't useless," Ksena said quickly.

"I am unascended," Estele corrected. "In this war, that means hostage or victim. I choose neither."

Grandmother stood up, dusting off her hands. "Enough talk. The planetary alignment is weak, but the ley line under this mountain is strong. It will have to do."

She looked at the three of them—Ksena, Alcuin, and herself. The anchors.

"Remember," she warned. "We are not powering her directly. We are opening the door. She has to walk through it."

They took their places.

Ksena closed her eyes and reached for the warmth. Not the angry fire of combat, but the deep, steady pulse she had learned to find in the training yard. She pushed it outward, feeling for Alcuin's jagged, bright energy on her left and Grandmother's immense, silent ocean on her right.

They connected.

The circle snapped shut.

The air in the cave changed instantly. Pressure dropped. The smell of ozone filled the space. The charcoal lines on the floor began to glow with a faint, violet light.

"Hold it!" Grandmother barked as the energy spiked.

Ksena gritted her teeth. It felt heavy. Like holding up a collapsing ceiling.

In the center, Estele gasped. She fell to her knees, clutching her chest.

"It burns!" she cried out.

"Let it in!" Grandmother shouted over the rising hum of power. "Do not fight the heat! Become the heat!"

Estele tried. Ksena could see her fighting the instinct to curl up and hide. She forced her back straight. She opened her arms.

The violet light surged. It wrapped around her legs, climbed her torso, and engulfed her head. Her scream cut off abruptly.

For a moment, there was silence.

Then the cave exploded with light.

Ksena was thrown backward into the wall. She hit hard, her vision swimming with spots.

"Estele!"

Smoke filled the room. The smell of scorched rock was overpowering.

In the center of the circle, the dust was settling.

A figure stood there.

Estele.

She was glowing. Literally glowing. Veins of silver light traced patterns under her skin, fading slowly as she breathed. Her eyes were open, and the irises were no longer brown. They were molten gold.

She looked at her hands. She flexed her fingers. Sparks danced between them, unbidden but controlled.

"Oh," she whispered. Her voice sounded different. Resonant. Like two people speaking at once.

Ksena scrambled to her feet. "Are you... are you okay?"

Estele looked at her. A slow smile spread across her face. It was the same smile Ksena had known for years, but the teeth seemed sharper.

"I feel..." Estele tilted her head back. "Everything."

She raised a hand. The campfire in the corner flared up, turning from red to blue to white, obeying her silent command.

"I can feel the wood burning. I can feel the air feeding it. It's not magic. It's conversation."

Grandmother leaned on her cane, looking exhausted but satisfied.

"Welcome to the conversation," she said dryly. "Try not to shout."

Alcuin brushed dirt off his knees, staring at Estele with wide eyes.

"That," he said, "was terrifying."

Estele laughed. The sound was bright and clear.

"Yes," she agreed. "Let's do it again."

"Not today," Grandmother said firmly. "The line needs to recharge. And so do you. Your body isn't used to carrying a sun inside its chest."

Estele nodded, the glow fading entirely now, leaving her looking human again. Just a girl in a dirty tunic.

But Ksena knew better.

The line had been crossed. The monopoly was broken.

They had made a god in a cave.

And if they could make one...

Ksena looked at Alcuin.

They could make an army.
