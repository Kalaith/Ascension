if you knew this would happen, why hasn't it happened sooner? Ksena asked the ancient exasperated
I can only interact with other ascendant, unless they could ascend by themselves I had no power, your ascension was incomplete but you are still an ascended, you where the first since the war to find me, and possibly the first ascendants not under their control since the end of the war, the ritual sites as well would only activate with an ascendant like yourself there
originally the sites would takes hundreds of us to gather to give it energy to transform into an ascendants, but instead, using your own ascension power even if it is incomplete was still enough to help him transform if he was ready.
he was ready? ascension is a special ritual for harnessing the power of the world, its not for every person, children could be born into it but others must prove they are worthy first, by traveling with you, protecting you and learning to think for himself he was found worthy

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

The hardest part was not the danger. It was timing. Every person they needed to help was on a clock they could not see: grandmother in chains, villages under threat, allies who would lose nerve if they waited too long. Ksena felt that pressure in her chest like a second heartbeat. Alcuin saw it and did what he always did when she started to spiral. He gave her one task at a time until breathing came back.

Ksena checked the map against the ridgeline twice before giving the signal to move. Alcuin did not argue this time; he simply shifted left to cover the blind angle and waited for Kirk to confirm the rear. They moved in silence through the cut stone until the wind changed, then dropped low and held position. No patrol crossed, but they stayed down until they were sure. That caution cost them an hour and likely saved them a fight.

At camp, they no longer talked in circles. They set watch order, reviewed water levels, and marked two fallback points in case the next approach collapsed. Kirk traced likely scout paths from his field notes and handed them to Ksena without comment. She folded the sheet and slid it into oilcloth. Alcuin watched both of them and finally said what none of them had said all day: they were tired, but they were no longer improvising every step.

The hardest moments came when the road went quiet. Quiet used to feel like safety. Now it felt like an ambush waiting for shape. Ksena forced herself to keep breathing steady and count terrain exits instead of threats she could not see. Alcuin stayed close enough to pull her back if she rushed, far enough to keep both of them alive if fire came from the wrong side. They had learned that distance was not emotional. It was tactical.

By the second watch, Kirk had the flare gun across his knees and Alcuin had his spear laid within arm's reach. Ksena sat with a slate and wrote three headings: confirmed, likely, unknown. She filled each column before sleeping. When she was done, she passed it to Alcuin. He added one line under confirmed: if they fought on bad ground, they died. No one argued with that.

Dawn brought no relief, only clarity. They had one path that kept them hidden, one contact who might still be reliable, and one objective that could not wait another week. Ksena looked at the route marks and felt fear settle into focus. She did not need to feel brave. She needed to move first and doubt later. Alcuin recognized the shift and gave a short nod. That was all the encouragement either of them used now.

When discussion turned to revenge, they shut it down and returned to sequence. Entry point, signal order, withdrawal line, casualty fallback. It sounded cold and necessary. Ksena still carried grief for every burned village, but she stopped treating grief as a plan. Alcuin still carried anger at the city, but he no longer let anger pick the route. Kirk still wanted a clean mission report, but he accepted this campaign would be won in fragments.

Before leaving camp, they buried the fire and erased their tracks to the stream crossing. Alcuin doubled back once to break a clear line and then rejoined at the stone arch. Ksena waited there with the map pressed against her chest, counting heartbeats until both men were in sight. They moved out together, and for the first time in days, the rhythm felt controlled instead of desperate.

By nightfall they reached the next shelter line with enough water left for one extra day. It was a small margin, but it changed their options. Ksena marked the cache point, Kirk logged coordinates, and Alcuin set a low alarm line of stones and metal scraps. None of it was dramatic. All of it mattered. They slept in shifts and woke still in the fight.
