if you knew this would happen, why hasn't it happened sooner? Ksena asked the ancient exasperated
I can only interact with other ascendant, unless they could ascend by themselves I had no power, your ascension was incomplete but you are still an ascended, you where the first since the war to find me, and possibly the first ascendants not under their control since the end of the war, the ritual sites as well would only activate with an ascendant like yourself there
originally the sites would takes hundreds of us to gather to give it energy to transform into an ascendants, but instead, using your own ascension power even if it is incomplete was still enough to help him transform if he was ready.
he was ready? ascension is a special ritual for harnessing the power of the world, its not for every person, children could be born into it but others must prove they are worthy first, by traveling with you, protecting you and learning to think for himself he was found worthy

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

The hardest part was not the danger. It was timing. Every person they needed to help was on a clock they could not see: grandmother in chains, villages under threat, allies who would lose nerve if they waited too long. Ksena felt that pressure in her chest like a second heartbeat. Alcuin saw it and did what he always did when she started to spiral. He gave her one task at a time until breathing came back.

They distributed the document copies on separate departure schedules, then changed each courier route at the last minute. If one line was compromised, the others might survive. Ksena watched the last rider disappear into the dawn fog and finally allowed herself one breath of relief. Then she turned back to camp and asked for the next risk board.
