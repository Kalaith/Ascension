Her Ascension was over, she had done it, the power ran through her body her sense heighten, power wore down on her shoulders, her power draping her body, but she felt it another power, as strong as hers building, she wasn’t the only one to have unlocked her full potential, her sisters body 

Her sister had unlocked the latent potential within her, had she broken free of the control, Ksena put her hand out towards her sister, but her sister lashed out, Ksena’s power only just covering her, as her sisters power hit her and send her across the room, Ksena hit the stone altar with a thud, her power protecting her but it still knocked the wind out of her chest, she looked up to her sister standing over her
‘Thank you for this power, with this I will be among the strongest of our people, stronger mother, of the elders and you’
‘But your free from their control.. Why..’
‘Yes I am, I shook free of there control as this power coursed through me, and for controlling me they will pay I will kill them all, everyone who forced my actions
But this is just a means to an end, since its done I will be the strongest and the one in control, the army will all bow before me’
‘We could fight and remove them from power and share this with our people, we will be stronger ever, isn’t that enough’
‘No, I will finish what I started and destroy you, I was the one that stopped your ascension and not some silly ritual, I couldn’t break free of it, it already bound me, but you had the potential to outshine me, you would come moms favorite, I couldn’t let you, and by letting you escape I knew somehow you would find a way to release me.
‘Its over, goodbye sister’ her sister brought her hand up and summoned more power had been used in thousands of years, Ksena was still just brought into hr power at this close

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

The flame at Alcuin's fingertips dimmed to a red ember and finally died. He stared at his hand for a long second, then looked up at Ksena.

"This isn't just your fight anymore," he said quietly.

Ksena stepped closer and set her palm against his wrist, steady and warm.

"Then we stop pretending it ever was."

They broke camp without another word, both aware that the next ritual would not be about unlocking power. It would be about controlling what that power turned them into.

Ksena checked the map against the ridgeline twice before giving the signal to move. Alcuin did not argue this time; he simply shifted left to cover the blind angle and waited for Kirk to confirm the rear. They moved in silence through the cut stone until the wind changed, then dropped low and held position. No patrol crossed, but they stayed down until they were sure. That caution cost them an hour and likely saved them a fight.

At camp, they no longer talked in circles. They set watch order, reviewed water levels, and marked two fallback points in case the next approach collapsed. Kirk traced likely scout paths from his field notes and handed them to Ksena without comment. She folded the sheet and slid it into oilcloth. Alcuin watched both of them and finally said what none of them had said all day: they were tired, but they were no longer improvising every step.

The hardest moments came when the road went quiet. Quiet used to feel like safety. Now it felt like an ambush waiting for shape. Ksena forced herself to keep breathing steady and count terrain exits instead of threats she could not see. Alcuin stayed close enough to pull her back if she rushed, far enough to keep both of them alive if fire came from the wrong side. They had learned that distance was not emotional. It was tactical.

By the second watch, Kirk had the flare gun across his knees and Alcuin had his spear laid within arm's reach. Ksena sat with a slate and wrote three headings: confirmed, likely, unknown. She filled each column before sleeping. When she was done, she passed it to Alcuin. He added one line under confirmed: if they fought on bad ground, they died. No one argued with that.

Dawn brought no relief, only clarity. They had one path that kept them hidden, one contact who might still be reliable, and one objective that could not wait another week. Ksena looked at the route marks and felt fear settle into focus. She did not need to feel brave. She needed to move first and doubt later. Alcuin recognized the shift and gave a short nod. That was all the encouragement either of them used now.

When discussion turned to revenge, they shut it down and returned to sequence. Entry point, signal order, withdrawal line, casualty fallback. It sounded cold and necessary. Ksena still carried grief for every burned village, but she stopped treating grief as a plan. Alcuin still carried anger at the city, but he no longer let anger pick the route. Kirk still wanted a clean mission report, but he accepted this campaign would be won in fragments.

Before leaving camp, they buried the fire and erased their tracks to the stream crossing. Alcuin doubled back once to break a clear line and then rejoined at the stone arch. Ksena waited there with the map pressed against her chest, counting heartbeats until both men were in sight. They moved out together, and for the first time in days, the rhythm felt controlled instead of desperate.

By nightfall they reached the next shelter line with enough water left for one extra day. It was a small margin, but it changed their options. Ksena marked the cache point, Kirk logged coordinates, and Alcuin set a low alarm line of stones and metal scraps. None of it was dramatic. All of it mattered. They slept in shifts and woke still in the fight.
