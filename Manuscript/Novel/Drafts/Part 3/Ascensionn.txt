Her Ascension was over, she had done it, the power ran through her body her sense heighten, power wore down on her shoulders, her power draping her body, but she felt it another power, as strong as hers building, she wasn’t the only one to have unlocked her full potential, her sisters body

Her sister had unlocked the latent potential within her, had she broken free of the control, Ksena put her hand out towards her sister, but her sister lashed out, Ksena’s power only just covering her, as her sisters power hit her and send her across the room, Ksena hit the stone altar with a thud, her power protecting her but it still knocked the wind out of her chest, she looked up to her sister standing over her
‘Thank you for this power, with this I will be among the strongest of our people, stronger mother, of the elders and you’
‘But your free from their control.. Why..’
‘Yes I am, I shook free of there control as this power coursed through me, and for controlling me they will pay I will kill them all, everyone who forced my actions
But this is just a means to an end, since its done I will be the strongest and the one in control, the army will all bow before me’
‘We could fight and remove them from power and share this with our people, we will be stronger ever, isn’t that enough’
‘No, I will finish what I started and destroy you, I was the one that stopped your ascension and not some silly ritual, I couldn’t break free of it, it already bound me, but you had the potential to outshine me, you would come moms favorite, I couldn’t let you, and by letting you escape I knew somehow you would find a way to release me.
‘Its over, goodbye sister’ her sister brought her hand up and summoned more power had been used in thousands of years, Ksena was still just brought into hr power at this close

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

The flame at Alcuin's fingertips dimmed to a red ember and finally died. He stared at his hand for a long second, then looked up at Ksena.

"This isn't just your fight anymore," he said quietly.

Ksena stepped closer and set her palm against his wrist, steady and warm.

"Then we stop pretending it ever was."

They broke camp without another word, both aware that the next ritual would not be about unlocking power. It would be about controlling what that power turned them into.

Alcuin tested again at dawn under Ksena's count, slower this time, with water and sand ready in case he slipped. He held the flame at fingertip height for ten breaths and killed it clean on the eleventh. It was progress, not mastery, but progress was enough to keep fear from owning the room.

Later, when the others slept, Alcuin lit one controlled spark and held it steady over the basin for a full count of twenty. No flare, no recoil, no panic. Ksena watched from the doorway and did not interrupt. When he finally extinguished it, she smiled without words. It was the first clean demonstration they had both believed.

By dawn, he could hold and extinguish the flame on command. Not perfect, but no longer accidental.
