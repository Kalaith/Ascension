The command deck sat high inside the human ship, all brushed metal, controlled light, and people moving like every second was budgeted.

Ksena and Alcuin followed Kirk through two security doors and one vertical lift that made Alcuin grip the rail until his knuckles went pale.

"Relax," Kirk said quietly.

"I am relaxed," Alcuin lied.

At the chamber entrance, two officers scanned them and stepped aside.

General Hale waited at the far end of a long table with three staff specialists and a translator unit running live semantic checks.

He rose when they entered.

"Thank you for coming aboard," he said. "I know this is not a small ask."

Ksena returned the greeting with a careful handshake, still slightly uncertain with the gesture.

Alcuin followed after watching her do it once.

Hale opened with mission parameters in plain language.

"We responded to a distress beacon routed from this world," he said. "Transit was six years. Our standing orders are peaceful contact, local coordination, and defense support where justified."

One of Ksena's accompanying council delegates stiffened at the phrase defense support.

Kirk caught it and translated intent before it could harden into accusation.

"He means conditional aid, not occupation," Kirk said.

The delegate relaxed by one degree.

Discussion moved into layered negotiation.

Humans wanted reliable incident reporting and clear command channels during crisis.

Local representatives wanted strict limits on foreign patrol movement and written non-annexation guarantees.

Terminology caused almost as much friction as policy.

When Hale said "framework," one elder heard "control architecture."

When an elder said "ancestral authority," a human analyst heard "theocratic veto."

Kirk spent half the session translating assumptions, not words.

Progress came in narrow increments.

No unilateral human patrols inside settlement zones.

Shared incident channel with dual verification.

Joint review board for external-threat intelligence release.

Dispute mechanism requiring two-party signature before force authorization.

Then came the question no one wanted but everyone needed.

"Your home is six years away," a delegate said to Hale. "What stops you from taking what you want and leaving us with procedure?"

Hale did not blink.

"Because our route stability depends on local cooperation, because our mission logs are audited by civilian oversight on Earth, and because command abuse on first contact is career-ending at minimum," he said. "Accountability is not optional for us."

No one smiled.

The delegate nodded once.

By the time the session closed, trust had not appeared.

Structure had.

That was enough for day one.

Outside the chamber, Alcuin waited near bulkhead glass with his hand resting on a knife he did not need but still carried out of habit.

Ksena came out with a signed draft packet in hand.

"Did we get anything real?" he asked.

She held up the packet.

"Not trust," she said. "Rules."

He considered that and nodded.

"Rules are a start."

Behind them, through the chamber door, human and local aides were already arguing over clause wording for the final copy.

The alliance had begun exactly where it had to.

Not with sentiment.

With constraints both sides could enforce.

The second visit to the human ship felt different from the first.

No ceremony. No polite tour language.

This time they were there to study a buried war.

Estele still found reasons to smile. She emerged from the guest quarters in a practical flight jacket tailored by ship crew and announced to no one in particular that humans understood fabric engineering at a spiritual level.

Ksena laughed. Alcuin pretended not to.

Kirk watched from the corridor and tried not to look too pleased by how quickly Estele had turned a military vessel into her personal fashion laboratory.

"Briefing in twelve minutes," he said. "Try to look like analysts, not celebrities."

Estele grinned. "No promises."

They met Hale in an engineering bay converted into a hybrid archive lab. Half the walls were covered by stitched satellite recon: crater chains, fused megastructures, subterranean grids, and debris signatures in near orbit.

Hale did not waste time.

"This world was not merely invaded," she said. "It was systematically regressed. Infrastructure burned, record systems targeted, recovery corridors denied."

Kirk expanded a map layer showing hidden transit tunnels below present-day settlements.

"Most current populations are living above dead cities," he said. "They inherited geography without institutions."

Ksena studied the projection with a hand braced on the table edge.

"Our collapse myths describe punishment by gods," she said. "This looks like planned attrition."

"It was," Hale replied.

She handed over a thin packet of declassified logs recovered from old beacon fragments.

Two allied species referenced in early defense records were never confirmed as extinct. No verified survivors either.

Then Kirk brought up the anomaly that had everyone in the room leaning forward.

"Intermittent encoded pings from deep strata," he said. "Not random noise. Patterned. Possibly automated. Possibly hidden communities."

Alcuin frowned. "If survivors remained underground, why never re-emerge?"

"Could be containment. Could be doctrine. Could be they don't trust surface factions," Hale said. "Could be all three."

The team spent hours correlating oral histories, ritual geography, and scan anomalies.

By late afternoon they had five candidate zones worth investigation.

None were easy.

Three sat under unstable fault shelves.

One lay inside active hostile range.

The fifth was below an old launch basin with unknown atmospheric toxins.

"So we pick between dangerous and worse," Estele said.

"Correct," Hale answered.

Before break, Hale pulled Ksena aside near the data wall.

"I need you to hear this directly," she said. "Command narrowed my engagement authority. I can continue intelligence, evacuation, and defensive logistics. Offensive support now requires tighter justification and more delay."

Ksena absorbed the constraint without visible frustration.

"Then we submit cleaner requests and tighter evidence chains," she said. "No assumptions."

Hale nodded once. "That answer is why this partnership is still possible."

On the return shuttle, silence held for most of the flight.

Below them, the landscape looked whole from altitude.

From this angle, you could almost believe history had been continuous.

But once you knew what lay under the forest and stone, every ridge looked like a scar hidden under skin.

Alcuin finally spoke as the landing skids touched down.

"I thought we were trying to end one regime," he said.

Ksena looked out at fractured plains and old city shadows.

"We are," she answered. "But we are also excavating everything that regime was built to hide."

Estele tightened her jacket and gave Kirk a sidelong look.

"And somewhere in all this," she said, "I still expect one uninterrupted day without strategy briefings."

Kirk snorted. "Schedule that after we finish rewriting civilization."

Estele smiled. "So never."

No one disagreed.

Ksena had never entered her father's residence.

From the outside it looked ceremonial, all polished stone and narrow windows. Inside it felt like a machine pretending to be a home. Too clean. Too quiet. No personal objects, no scent of cooking, no stray fabric left where someone had lived a real day.

Alcuin closed the door behind them and listened.

"No guards in the front rooms," he whispered.

"That means they trust the barrier," Ksena said. "Or they want us to think they do."

They split and moved fast.

Ksena found the laboratory first. Glass cabinets lined one wall. Old war fragments sat in numbered trays. A console glowed with technical logs, most of them classified under her father's command seals.

She scrolled through ritual entries with shaking fingers.

Control lattice calibration.

Ascendant compliance drift.

Conduit thresholds by bloodline.

Her stomach turned. The crystal system was not governance. It was architecture for obedience.

She copied what she could to a storage shard and moved on.

A second door led into a lower corridor that did not appear on city maps. At the end stood a sealed gate keyed to ascendant signature.

Ksena pressed her palm to the plate. Heat spread through the lock. The gate opened.

The chamber beyond was dark, narrow, and cold.

A woman hung from suspended restraints in the center, wrists bound above her head by dull red metal. Her skin was pale, her hair silver and matted, and every breath looked borrowed.

"Grandmother," Ksena whispered.

The woman's eyes opened by a sliver.

"Do not touch the chains," she rasped.
Alcuin checked pulse and stepped back. "Alive. Barely."

Ksena forced her voice steady. "We're getting you out."

"Not with brute force." Grandmother's words came in short bursts. "Shackles drain any ascendant who grabs them. They are keyed to a bio-resonance frequency. His frequency."

Ksena swallowed. "I have his blood. Half of it."

"Not enough," Grandmother whispered. "You have to match the resonance. You have to tune your own nervous system to match a man you hate. It will hurt."

Ksena looked at the shackles pulsing with dull red light. "How much?"

"Like burning out a nerve."

"Why did people follow him?" Ksena asked.

"He saved us in war," grandmother said. "Then he turned emergency authority into permanent rule. By the time we understood, many were already bound."

Her gaze sharpened, focusing on Ksena's face.

"Your mother?"

"Alive. Controlled."

Pain passed across grandmother's features so quickly Ksena almost missed it.

"Then we move now," grandmother said. "Before he returns."

They left the chamber and sealed it behind them.

Outside, city patrol density had doubled near the ritual district. From an observation niche, Ksena and Alcuin watched her father and several elders circle the pedestal in synchronized calibration.

No opening.

Alcuin pulled her into shadow.

"We need a split plan," he said.

"Too risky."

"Everything here is risky. Listen. I pull attention to the barrier edge and ritual quarter. You take the gem and free her."

Ksena shook her head immediately. "If they corner you in open air-"

"Then I run. I'm better at that than anyone in your city."

She hated that he was right.

They hid in an abandoned housing block until second watch. Alcuin dozed in short intervals, one hand on his blade. Ksena stared at the ceiling and counted breathing cycles to keep panic from owning her.

Near dawn, patrol patterns shifted. Smaller teams. Wider gaps.

"Now," Alcuin said.

Before he moved, Ksena grabbed his jacket and kissed him hard enough to interrupt his next sentence.

When she pulled back, both of them were breathing too fast.

"Forest rendezvous," she said. "Old marker stone."

"Do not miss it."

He went first.

Minutes later, fire lit the eastern sky. One blast struck near the ritual tower. Another hit outer wall plating. Then more, staggered to imply multiple attackers.

Sirens rose.

Patrols launched.

Ksena ran low through side streets, never taking open lanes. There was no gem to find. The key was internal.

She stopped in a shadow and closed her eyes. She reached for the memory of her father—the cold, precise weight of his presence. She hated it. But she let it in. She forced her own inner hum to flatten, to cool, to mimic that suffocating order.

It felt like swallowing ice. Her veins ached. Her heart stuttered, forced into a rhythm that wasn't hers.

"Close enough," she gasped.

She ran back.

Inside the lower chamber, grandmother hung where she had left her.

Ksena grabbed the shackles.

The red light flared, tasting her resonance. verifying the signature.

It burned. Not heat. Rejection. It tried to push her out, but she held the false rhythm, clamping down on her own soul until the lock clicked.

The chains fell open.

Grandmother dropped.

Ksena caught her by sheer force of will and bruised shoulders.

"I have you," she said.

Grandmother could not stand on her own. Ksena shifted her weight, slung one arm over her back, and half-carried her into the upper corridor.

They reached the study entrance.

Kalani stood in the doorway.

Her smile did not reach her eyes.

"I knew you would come here," she said. "You were always predictable where family is involved."

Ksena tightened her grip on grandmother. "Move."

"No."

Kalani's flame lifted around her shoulders like a living cloak.

"You are not leaving with the prisoner," she said. "But if you surrender now, I can keep you close."

Grandmother leaned into Ksena and whispered, almost soundless, "Do not negotiate."

Ksena felt the wrapped gem burn hot through the fabric at her belt. She set her stance, measured distance, and looked directly at her sister.

"Then stop me," she said.
