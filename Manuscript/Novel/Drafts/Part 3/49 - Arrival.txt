There arrival blotted out the sky Ksena gasped as she recognized the ships, these where the ships for the ancient enemy that had supposedly been destroyed.. But how if they destroyed
Kirk looked over to Ksena, I hope they are your ships, because they are not mine
Ksena shook her head, they are the ancient enemy, the ones that attacked before we became ascended, the ones the beacons asked for help
Kirk gulped, the fleet coming into orbit was huge, and their biggest shes made the human vessel look tiny, if this enemy was attacking in force, Kirk doubted there was anything the humans could do to help
They do not look friendly, at this rate I don't know if our forces could do anything to that many ships
Ksena nodded, still staring up at the ships, the ascendant powers where powerful but these ships looked on a whole other level, had her ancestors really fought them off before, and now with her race divided, will they be able to do so again.

Kirk lowered the binoculars and spoke without taking his eyes off the sky. "That formation is not reconnaissance. It is occupation."

Ksena forced herself to count hulls, spacing, escort rings, and descent vectors. Panic blurred the shape of a threat. Numbers sharpened it. There we're carriers, heavy escorts, and a wedge of smaller craft already peeling toward the old city corridor. Whoever commanded that fleet had studied the terrain and chosen pressure points on purpose.

"We warn everyone on the western line first," she said. "If they cut the passes, half the settlements will be trapped before dusk."

Alcuin unfolded the cloth map on a flat stone and stabbed a finger at three narrow canyons. "These are the only routes big enough for supply carts. If they hold these, they hold the lowlands."

Kirk keyed his headset and relayed a short burst to the human ship, then looked back at them. "My captain can shadow the outer edge, but we cannot hold orbit alone. You need people moving now."

Ksena nodded. The fleet above them felt like the return of an old nightmare, but the ground beneath her boots was real, and so we're the choices in front of her. She split their routes in minutes: Alcuin to the ridge clans, Kirk to airborne reconnaissance, and herself to the city gate council.

When they separated at the first fork, Ksena turned once and looked up at the darkening sky. The enemy had arrived in force. This time, they would meet a world that remembered.
