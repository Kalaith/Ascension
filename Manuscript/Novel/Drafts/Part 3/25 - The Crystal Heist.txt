They called it a training exercise until the third night.

Then Grandmother told them the real target.

"The Barrier Core," she said, tapping the center of the City map.

"The one Kalani broke out of?" Alcuin asked.

"No," Grandmother corrected. "The master node. The one that controls the shield geometry. If the fleet arrives tomorrow—and the stars say they will—we need control of the door."

"And if we don't?" Estele asked.

"Then they land wherever they want. And we fight a war on ten fronts instead of one."

The plan was madness. Walk into the heart of the enemy stronghold, steal the most guarded object on the planet, and walk out.

"We don't walk," Ksena said. "We infiltrate."

They used the old sewer lines. The smell hadn't improved in centuries. Rats skittered away from their lights.

Alcuin led the way, sensing vibrations in the rock to avoid patrols. Estele masked their heat signatures. Ksena held the rear, her kinetic sense extended like a radar net.

They breached the lower levels of the Ritual Tower at 0300. The corridors were silent, lined with white marble that seemed to glow in the dark.

"Stop," Ksena hissed, holding up a fist.

A laser grid barred the hallway ahead. Invisible to the naked eye, but screaming in her kinetic sense.

"Sensor mesh," she whispered. "If we break the beam, the whole tower wakes up."

"I can't melt it," Estele said. "It's light, not matter."

"I can bend it," Alcuin said. "But only for a second. The crystal emitters are sensitive to vibration."

He placed his hands on the floor. He closed his eyes.

"Ready?"

"No," Ksena said. "But go."

Alcuin pulsed the floor. The emitters shuddered, misaligning by a fraction of a millimeter. The grid flickered.

"Now!"

They sprinted. Through the gap. Past the lethal light.

The grid snapped back on behind them with a hum.

"Too close," Estele breathed.

They took the lift up. The hum of the tower grew louder as they ascended.

The Core Chamber was empty. Suspiciously empty.

"Where are they?" Ksena asked, scanning the room.

"Maybe they think the barrier protects itself," Alcuin suggested.

"Or maybe they're waiting for us," Grandmother's voice crackled over the comms. "Hurry. I'm reading a power surge in the upper grid."

The Master Crystal hovered in the center of the room. It was huge—a jagged, pulsing heart of pure white light. It wasn't just a crystal; it was a cage. Inside the lattice, Ksena could see memories. Faces. Screams. The stolen will of a thousand ascendants trapped to power the shield.

"It's... alive," she whispered.

"It's a battery," Alcuin said, disgusted.

"How do we move this?" he asked. "It's enormous."

"We don't move the whole lattice," Ksena said. "We take the Key."

She pointed to a smaller, darker shard embedded in the base. It thrummed with a different frequency.

"The locking mechanism," she realized. "If we take that, the shield defaults to manual."

"Manual means we can open it," Estele said.

"Means anyone can," Ksena corrected. "Including us."

She reached for the shard.

Her hand passed through a localized field. Cold. Numbing.

"It's warded," she hissed. "Blood magic."

"Of course it is," Alcuin muttered. "Whose blood?"

"Mine," a voice said from the shadows.

Her father stepped out from behind a pillar.

He looked tired. Older. But his eyes were sharp. He wore the robes of the High Architect, pristine and terrifying.

"I expected you sooner," he said.

"Father," Ksena said, not lowering her hand.

"You think you can stop the fleet?" he asked. "They are coming to burn this world, Ksena. I am trying to save it."

"By enslaving it?"

"By organizing it. Survival requires hierarchy. If we are divided, they will squash us. If we are united—even by force—we stand a chance."

"That's not unity," Ksena said. "That's a meat shield."

"It is necessary," he said. He raised a hand. "Step away from the Key."

Ksena didn't step away. She laughed.

"You still think this is about you," she said.

"It is always about me. I am the Architect."

"Then you missed a flaw in your design."

"And what is that?"

"People don't like being bricks."

She grabbed the Key.

The ward flared. It burned her skin. It felt like sticking her hand into a blast furnace. The pain arced up her arm, seizing her chest. The smell of burning flesh filled the air.

But she didn't let go. She pushed her own resonance into it. Not Command. Chaos.

The crystal screamed.

The ward shattered.

Her father shouted, stumbling back as the backlash hit him.

Ksena ripped the Key free. Her hand was charred, smoking.

"Run!" she yelled.

They bolted for the lift. Alarms screamed to life. The whole tower shook.

"They're sealing the exits!" Alcuin shouted.

"Make a new one!" Ksena ordered.

Alcuin slammed his fist into the wall. The stone blew outward, revealing the night sky.

"Jump!"

They dove into the air.

Estele caught them with a cushion of rising heat, slowing their fall just enough to survive the landing on the lower roof.

They scrambled across the tiles, the Key pulsing in Ksena's pocket like a second heartbeat. It hurt, but it was a good hurt.

Behind them, the Ritual Tower groaned.

"We got it," Alcuin panted.

"We got their attention," Ksena corrected.

She looked up at the stars. They were blocked by shadows.

Massive shadows.

"They're here," she whispered.

The fleet had arrived. And they were holding the doorbell.
