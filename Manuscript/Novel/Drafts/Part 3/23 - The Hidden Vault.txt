"We need weapons, not promises," Kaelen had said.

So they went looking for weapons.

"The Vault of the First Seed," Grandmother announced, pointing at a dusty map she had laid out on the clan's rough table. "Sealed before the Crystal Regime centralized power. Before the Blood Lie."

"Sounds convenient," Alcuin said, sharpening his blade.

"It sounds dangerous," Ksena corrected. "Why wasn't it raided centuries ago?"

"Because the location was purged from the archives," Grandmother replied. "And because the entrance is under the acid lake."

Alcuin stopped sharpening. "Under the what?"

"The lake is seasonal," Grandmother said calmly. "It recedes in the dry season. Which is now."

They stood at the edge of the basin three days later. The ground was cracked and yellow with sulfur. The air burned their throats.

"Masks on," Ksena ordered.

They descended into the dry bed.

The entrance was hidden behind a rock fall. Alcuin moved the stones with a wave of his hand, his control precise now, no longer fighting the earth but asking it to shift.

Behind the rocks lay a heavy iron door, etched with symbols that predated the City.

"Open it," Grandmother said.

Ksena placed her palm on the lock. It didn't respond to heat. It didn't respond to force.

"It wants resonance," she realized. "Not command. Harmony."

"All of us," Grandmother said.

They placed their hands on the door. Ksena, Alcuin, Estele. Earth, Fire, and the Void between.

The door groaned. Dust fell from the frame.

It swung inward.

The air inside was stale but breathable.

"Light," Ksena whispered.

Estele summoned a floating orb of cold fire to guide them.

The vault wasn't a room. It was a library. Shelves lined the walls, filled not with books, but with crystals. Thousands of them. Uncut. Raw.

"Inheritance," Grandmother breathed. "Enough to arm ten generations."

But they weren't alone.

Shapes moved in the shadows.

"Automata," Alcuin warned, raising a shield. "Old guard constructs."

Mechanical spiders, rusted but functional, scuttled from the corners. Their eyes glowed red. They didn't have guns. They had blades.

"Defensive formation!" Ksena shouted.

The fight was ugly. CQC in narrow aisles.

Alcuin shattered the floor to trap the larger constructs. Estele burned through metal chassis with concentrated heat. Ksena moved like water, deflecting strikes and disabling joints with kinetic bursts.

They fought as a unit. No hesitation. No verbal commands. Just instinct honed by weeks of brutal training.

When the last spider fell, twitching, silence returned to the vault.

"We clear?" Alcuin panted, wiping oil from his face.

"Clear," Ksena confirmed.

She walked to the nearest shelf and picked up a crystal. It was clear as water. No red tint. No control lattice.

"Clean," she said. "No backdoors. No blood locks."

She turned to her team.

"We take what we can carry. Then we send the runners."

"To who?" Estele asked, eyeing the hoard.

"To everyone," Ksena said. "We don't hoarding this. We distribute it. Every village, every clan, every exile who wants to fight gets a stone."

Alcuin grinned. "The City isn't going to like that."

"Good," Ksena said, pocketing the crystal. "Let's make sure they hate it."
