"We need weapons, not promises," Kaelen had said.

So they went looking for weapons.

"The Vault of the First Seed," Grandmother announced, pointing at a dusty map she had laid out on the clan's rough table. "Sealed before the Crystal Regime centralized power. Before the Blood Lie."

"Sounds convenient," Alcuin said, sharpening his blade. The rasp of the whetstone was the only sound in the room for a long moment.

"It sounds dangerous," Ksena corrected. "Why wasn't it raided centuries ago?"

"Because the location was purged from the archives," Grandmother replied. "And because the entrance is under the acid lake."

Alcuin stopped sharpening. "Under the what?"

"The lake is seasonal," Grandmother said calmly. "It recedes in the dry season. Which is now."

They stood at the edge of the basin three days later. The ground was cracked and yellow with sulfur. The air burned their throats. The "lake" was now a vast expanse of dried chemical sludge, fragile and treacherous.

"Masks on," Ksena ordered, pulling up her scarf.

They descended into the dry bed.

The ground crunched underfoot like old bone. Every few steps, a pocket of gas would hiss from a fissure.

"Watch your step," Alcuin warned. "The crust is thin here. Beneath it is..."

He tossed a stone. It broke through the surface crust and vanished with a wet *glorp*. Smoke rose from the hole.

"...still liquid," he finished.

They moved in single file, Alcuin testing the ground with his earth-sense, guiding them along a ridge of solid rock hidden beneath the sludge.

"Are we just grave robbers?" Alcuin asked suddenly, his voice muffled by his scarf. "Digging up the past because we can't build a future?"

Ksena paused. The wind howled across the desolate flat.

"We aren't robbing a grave," she said. "We're retrieving an inheritance. These weapons were made to defend the people, not control them. We're just returning them to their owners."

"If the owners survived," Alcuin muttered, but he kept walking.

The entrance was hidden behind a rock fall at the far end of the basin. Alcuin moved the stones with a wave of his hand, his control precise now, no longer fighting the earth but asking it to shift.

Behind the rocks lay a heavy iron door, etched with symbols that predated the City.

"Open it," Grandmother said.

Ksena placed her palm on the lock. It didn't respond to heat. It didn't respond to force.

"It wants resonance," she realized. "Not command. Harmony."

"All of us," Grandmother said.

They placed their hands on the door. Ksena, Alcuin, Estele. Earth, Fire, and the Void between.

The door groaned. Dust fell from the frame. It swung inward, revealing a tunnel that spiraled down into the dark.

The air inside was stale but breathable.

"Light," Ksena whispered.

Estele summoned a floating orb of cold fire to guide them.

The tunnel wasn't empty. Ten meters in, the air pressure dropped.

"Whoa!" Estele stumbled, clutching her head.

"Ear maze," Grandmother warned. "Old defense. The Architect didn't like uninvited guests."

The corridor didn't twist, but it felt like it did. Up felt like left. Down felt like sideways. Nausea rolled in Ksena's stomach. Her inner ear screamed that she was falling.

"Focus on the rail!" Grandmother shouted. "The rail is the constant! Ignore your eyes!"

They crawled along the central rail, their bodies reacting to phantom gravity.

"This is impossible!" Alcuin grunted, dragging himself forward.

"It's a filter," Ksena gasped. "Only those with discipline pass. Panic, and your brain shuts down."

They pushed through. Inch by inch. Until the pressure suddenly vanished, dropping them onto the smooth floor of the antechamber.

The vault lay beyond.

It wasn't a room. It was a library of war. Shelves lined the walls, filled not with books, but with crystals. Thousands of them. Uncut. Raw.

"Inheritance," Grandmother breathed. "Enough to arm ten generations."

But they weren't alone.

Shapes moved in the shadows. The sound of stone grinding on stone echoed off the walls.

"Guardians," Alcuin warned, raising a shield. "Entombed."

Figures emerged from the walls—not walking out of them, but peeling off them. They were humanoid, but their skin was fused with the cavern rock. Calcified armor. Faces worn smooth by centuries of drip-water. They didn't look like machines. They looked like statues that remembered how to kill.

"Don't destroy them if you can help it!" Grandmother shouted. "They are heritage too!"

"They're trying to crush us!" Estele yelled, blasting a smaller statue that lunged at her. It didn't burn; the rock just glowed red and kept coming.

The fight was ugly. CQC in narrow aisles.

Alcuin shattered the floor to trap the heavy guardians, sinking them into pits of stone. Estele focused on the joints, melting the limestone knees to immobilize them.

The centurion equivalent—a massive, moss-covered giant—charged Ksena. It was twice her height, with fists like boulders.

Ksena didn't block. She dodged, sliding under its first strike. She placed her hand on its leg.

*Stop.*

She didn't use force. She used the kinetic dampening technique she had been practicing. She leached the momentum out of the stone.

The giant stumbled, its weight suddenly static. It fell forward, paralyzed by its own mass.

Ksena vaulted onto its back and found the seal at the neck—the place where the magic binding held the stone together. She didn't break it. She just disrupted the flow.

The statue froze. No longer alive. Just rock.

"Clear!" she shouted.

"We clear?" Alcuin panted, wiping oil from his face. He was standing on top of a trapped guardian, keeping it pinned with a pillar of rock.

"Clear," Ksena confirmed.

She walked to the nearest shelf and picked up a crystal. It was clear as water. No red tint. No control lattice.

"Clean," she said. "No backdoors. No blood locks."

She turned to her team.

"We take what we can carry. Then we send the runners."

"To who?" Estele asked, eyeing the hoard. "This is dangerous power."

"To everyone," Ksena said. "We don't hoarding this. We distribute it. Every village, every clan, every exile who wants to fight gets a stone."

"The logistics..." Alcuin started.

"Are impossible," Ksena said. "Which is why nobody will expect us to do it."

Alcuin grinned. "The City isn't going to like that."

"Good," Ksena said, pocketing the crystal. "Let's make sure they hate it."

They spent the next hour loading packs. The crystals were heavy, buzzing with potential energy. Walking back through the gravity trap with the extra weight would be a nightmare.

But as Ksena hoisted her pack, she felt lighter than she had in years.

They weren't just rebels anymore. They were suppliers.

And the war had just changed markets.
