the power not only coursed through him, it changed him, Ksena full ascension was overtaken has all eyes turned to face him, as the power coursed through his body, his frame started to compress, his skin grew smooth and darkened getting closer to a deep purple, his face changed to being more sculptured and refined and his eyes grew brighter, by the end of it his body wrapped in power, he could have been mistaken as Ksena brother and not as a different species
Ksena realized this was the truth, they where not two different people, after they had managed to repeal the ancient invaders the ascended had somehow been turned against there own race, there was only one true face and by going through the ritual with her, he had reached it, the ancient had known all along that this would have happened
now with his ascension done others from his race would do it as we'll, the elders we're losing control this is what they had tried to hide, why they had committed these atrocities they wanted to stop them from being able to ascend and oppose them
Every time they felt one was getting close they would attack and destroy the entire village and remove all trace of it, they had likely only kept them around so they where not guilty of wiping out there forefathers and so they could continue to use them as labor.

No one in camp slept that night.

Alcuin sat apart from the others, turning his hands in the firelight as if they belonged to someone else. His features had shifted only enough to unsettle every memory he carried of himself. The old tribal marks on his forearms looked stranger against skin now threaded with faint luminescent veins.

Ksena crouched beside him with a waterskin. "Say it," she said. "Whatever it is."

He stared into the coals. "If this keeps happening to others, your elders did not just lie. They built a whole world on a lie."

She did not defend them. "I know."

By dawn they had moved from shock to planning. If ascension could awaken dormant lineage across both communities, then hiding the ritual had never been about safety. It had been about monopoly. That changed recruitment, diplomacy, and every risk calculation they had made.

Kirk rewrote their contact priorities on a slate: villages with known bloodline records first, then labor settlements, then outer caravans. "If people realize what was taken from them," he warned, "you get a wave. Maybe hope, maybe chaos."

"Both," Ksena said.

Alcuin rose and rolled his shoulders, still stiff from the transformation. "Then we give them structure before fear gets there first."

They spent the morning drafting a message that was simple enough to repeat and hard enough to weaponize: ascension was not city birthright, not elder property, and not proof of moral rank. It was inheritance stolen, now returning.

When the first courier left camp with that message sewn inside his collar, Ksena watched him disappear into dust and understood they had crossed another threshold. They we're no longer only fugitives. They we're a contagion of truth.
