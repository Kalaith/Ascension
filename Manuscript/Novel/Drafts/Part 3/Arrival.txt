There arrival blotted out the sky Ksena gasped as she recognized the ships, these where the ships for the ancient enemy that had supposedly been destroyed.. But how if they destroyed
Kirk looked over to Ksena, I hope they are your ships, because they are not mine
Ksena shook her head, they are the ancient enemy, the ones that attacked before we became ascended, the ones the beacons asked for help
Kirk gulped, the fleet coming into orbit was huge, and their biggest shes made the human vessel look tiny, if this enemy was attacking in force, Kirk doubted there was anything the humans could do to help
They do not look friendly, at this rate I don't know if our forces could do anything to that many ships
Ksena nodded, still staring up at the ships, the ascendant powers where powerful but these ships looked on a whole other level, had her ancestors really fought them off before, and now with her race divided, will they be able to do so again.

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena stood at the edge of camp and watched the eastern horizon lighten. The city they were heading toward might offer allies, or another trap wrapped in polite words, but waiting here would not make either outcome better.

Alcuin joined her, tightening the strap on his pack.

"You ready?" he asked.

She nodded once. "No more drifting. We choose the ground from now on."

Kirk gave a short signal from behind them, and the three of them moved out before sunrise, keeping low between the stone cuts as if the land itself was listening.

At the next ridge break, Ksena halted and watched two patrol lanterns pass below without changing course. For once, being unseen felt like control instead of luck. She traced a new mark on the map margin and handed it to Alcuin. "This route stays," she said. He checked the wind, checked the slope, and nodded. They moved before the moon shifted.
