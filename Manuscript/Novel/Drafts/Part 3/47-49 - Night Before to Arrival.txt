Interlude - The Night Before

Wind scraped along the canyon wall and carried the smell of cold ash into camp. Ksena sat with her back against a supply crate, polishing dirt from a blade she almost never used now that power answered faster than steel. Across the fire, Alcuin sorted signal tags by touch in the dark, memorizing edges so he could identify each one without light.

Kirk checked the same route board three times, then erased it anyway and redrew the approach from memory. "If we lose the board," he said, "we lose paper, not sequence."

No one argued.

The mission clock on Kirk's wrist read 22:14. Eight hours until movement.

Ksena broke the silence first. "What are we missing?"

Alcuin did not look up. "Weather shift at dawn. Wind from the east. It will carry sound farther on the south approach."

Kirk added a note. "So we shorten verbal range and switch to touch confirmation inside the final corridor."

They worked through contingencies until the list ran out: comms failure, shield delay, extraction injury, false surrender. Every scenario ended with the same instruction written at the bottom of the slate: civilians out first.

Near midnight, grandmother joined them, wrapped in a heavy cloak and moving slower than she liked to admit. She studied their board and tapped the line assigning Ksena to rear guard on exit.

"You are not invincible," grandmother said.

"I know," Ksena replied.

"Then prove it by living through this operation."

After grandmother left, Ksena stared at the fire until the coals dimmed. Alcuin slid one signal tag toward her, the one marked for retreat trigger.

"If it goes wrong, you call it," he said.

She closed her fingers around the tag. "If it goes wrong, we all leave together."

At 03:00 they geared up in silence. Kirk ran the last sync check. Alcuin tightened Ksena's left gauntlet strap when her hands started to shake. She did the same for him.

When the signal light turned green, they stepped into the dark canyon single-file, not fearless, but decided.

Everyone sit down and do your best to put the seat belts on you, we will be moving very fast and you want to be holding on very tightly

Kirk finished canging the massive array of buttons, switches and levers that left even the curious Ksena speechless, the ship rocked as Kalani was outside attacking it

Ready to take of Kirk said into his headseat

Roger, opening main door, that banshee out there is attacking like crazy, we will need to be getting out of here s soon as you leave

alaRoger kirk replied

Alcuin watched as the door startd to open up, the ship rocked again as anothe ball of fire hit it, they could see the smoke through the open door

As soon as the door was fully open, Ksenda could see her sister flying outside

Hold n everyone kirk said, Alcion gripped his seat hard, the movement was still faster anyone expected as Kirk floored it, the jet taking of from the ship and just narrowly dodging the next fireball from Kalani,

Ksena wanted to turn her head to face towards Kalani and the ship but she couldn't move her head as the zero gs passed against, she ccouldn't see the human ship fly of in the opposite direction, or her sister go tumbling through the air at the prssure change

Okay Kirk called out, we have cleared her, she will not be able to catch up to us, she isn't that fast, he slowed the ship a little, enough that all the force wasn't pressing against them allowing Alcuin to breathe, the feeling was nt one he would soon forget

How long will it take to arrive Ksena yelled out

At our current speed it should only take an hour

That fast alcuin said as he tried to look out the plane and see the landscape, which was the wrong move for him and her had to cover his eyes placing his head between his legs as he recovered from the veritgo this ship was moving fast, a journey that would have taken them a month would be over in an hour, Alcuin was still unsure whic he prefered, the pressure still against his chest was painful, travel by foot would habe been much better

Eventually with his asceded powers they would learn how to fly like Kalani, Alcuin didn't think he would rush, Ksena o the other hand was loving itm ad couldn't wait to be able to fly for herself, this is something she would dfiantly be practising, hopefully the ascended they were going to visit would be able to teach them, between the two of them and katesh they should be able to handle her, and hopefully capture her before she can do any harm to anyone else

Ksena was still in shock about her sster, how could she do things like this, the sister she remembered was kind and gentle, the word the human had used this not describe her older sister, but she must be there somewhere and Ksena would rescue her and get to the bottom of all of this

Kirk kept the craft low through the canyon shadows, engines whining as he threaded rock spires that would have shredded the wings at full tilt. Behind them, Kalani's fire scorched the air in bright streaks, close enough that heat rolled through the cabin.

"She is learning the trajectory," Kirk shouted. "I need a disruption window."

Ksena unstrapped with effort, braced one hand against the frame, and opened the side observation hatch a crack. Wind knifed through the compartment. She reached into the slipstream and pushed a pulse of light down and right, turning dust into a false thermal bloom along the canyon floor.

Kalani took the bait for two seconds. It was enough.

Kirk slammed the throttle. The craft shot through a narrow split in the stone and climbed hard into cloud cover. By the time Kalani corrected, they were already beyond visual range.

Alcuin finally exhaled and sagged against his restraints, face pale from the acceleration. "Tell me we are done flying for today."

"Not a chance," Kirk muttered, eyes fixed on instruments. "But we are alive."

They touched down in a hidden ravine an hour later with engines ticking hot and everyone shaking from adrenaline. No one called it a victory. They had not beaten Kalani. They had escaped her.

Ksena stood on the landing strut and looked back toward the eastern sky where smoke still smeared the horizon. "She is faster than before," she said.

Alcuin joined her. "Then next time we do not rely on speed."

Kirk closed the hatch and keyed a silent beacon for friendly tracking only. "Next time," he said, "we pick the battlefield first."

The fleet arrived like weather turning violent.

Ksena saw the first hull break cloud and felt old fear move through her spine before thought caught up.

Then more shapes followed.

Carriers.

Heavy escorts.

Fast wedges peeling toward strategic corridors.

Within minutes the sky was no longer sky. It was occupied geometry.

Kirk lowered binoculars and did not bother softening his read.

"That is not reconnaissance," he said. "That is staging for control."

Alcuin spread a cloth map over a flat stone and anchored corners with spent casings.

"If they hold these three canyons," he said, tapping each route in turn, "lowland supply dies in two days."

Ksena forced herself to count instead of panic.

Hull spacing.

Descent vectors.

Escort pattern.

Whoever commanded the formation had studied terrain and chosen pressure points deliberately.

"Western settlements first," she said. "If passes close before warning, half the civilian population gets trapped by dusk."

Kirk keyed his headset and transmitted burst priority to orbit command.

"Captain can shadow edge lanes," he said, listening to static and delayed confirmations. "We cannot contest full orbit alone. Ground movement starts now."

Ksena nodded.

The sky above was terrifying.

The ground beneath her boots still required decisions.

She split routes in under a minute.

Alcuin to ridge clans and canyon wardens.

Kirk to aerial recon and comm relay.

Ksena to city gate council and emergency corridor authority.

No one argued.

They moved.

At the first fork, Alcuin caught her arm.

"Do not negotiate from guilt," he said. "Negotiate from leverage."

She almost laughed at the timing.

"When did you become strategic?"

"Around the third city trying to kill us."

He ran west.

Kirk launched with two scouts and climbed toward cloud shelf where radar shadows were thin.

Ksena took the south trail at full speed.

By the time she reached gate council, rumors had already outrun facts.

Some argued immediate surrender to avoid bombardment.

Some demanded preemptive strikes on suspected collaborators.

Some denied fleet identity entirely and called it human deception.

Ksena waited until shouting peaked, then ignited a narrow line of flame over the center table just high enough to command silence.

"Listen," she said. "You do not need to trust me. You need to count timelines."

She outlined descent windows, pass vulnerabilities, shelter capacities, and evacuation order in hard numbers.

Panic did not vanish.

It became operational.

By nightfall, warning runners were moving west, grain convoys were redirected, and first shelter sectors were opening under mixed supervision.

Above, fleet lights shifted into lower holding patterns.

The invasion had not started yet.

It had announced itself.

On the ridge outside council hall, Ksena paused once and looked up at the darkened sky.

Her ancestors had faced this enemy and survived long enough to leave warnings.

This time the world they left behind was fractured, suspicious, and underprepared.

It was also not helpless.

Ksena touched the signal bead at her throat and sent one short message to both Alcuin and Kirk.

"Routes active. Civilians moving. We hold." 

Wind answered first.

Then two confirmation tones returned, one from west trail, one from cloud layer.

She turned back toward the city and kept walking.

The enemy had arrived in force.

This time they would meet a world that remembered and adapted.
