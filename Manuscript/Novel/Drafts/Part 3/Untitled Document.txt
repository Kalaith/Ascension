Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

The hardest part was not the danger. It was timing. Every person they needed to help was on a clock they could not see: grandmother in chains, villages under threat, allies who would lose nerve if they waited too long. Ksena felt that pressure in her chest like a second heartbeat. Alcuin saw it and did what he always did when she started to spiral. He gave her one task at a time until breathing came back.

When night came again, they did not talk about destiny or victory. They talked about watch order, entry angles, and who would carry the signal flare if they had to run. Ksena still thought about Kalani every time she closed her eyes, but she no longer mistook anger for strategy. Alcuin still doubted what the power was doing to him, but he stopped hiding every sign of it. Kirk still wanted a clean mission report for command, but he had accepted this world would not give clean endings.

Before sleeping, Ksena sat with a slate and wrote the same three lines she now wrote every night: what they confirmed, what they still guessed, and what would kill them if they were wrong. It was a brutal habit, but it kept lies from creeping back in when fear rose. Alcuin read the list over her shoulder and added one more line at the bottom. 'Protect the people who cannot run.' She underlined it once and closed the slate.

At the end of the checklist, Alcuin drew a line through the page and wrote one word above it: READY. Ksena stared at it for a moment, then signed beneath it. Kirk added the time stamp and closed the binder.

Before closing the operations binder, Ksena added one last line beneath the checklist: "No unscheduled heroics." Alcuin snorted, then signed beside it anyway. Kirk stamped the page with time and location and sealed the cover. It was an unglamorous moment, but it made the next move feel like an operation instead of a gamble.

As they moved out, the binder stayed closed; from this point, execution replaced planning.
