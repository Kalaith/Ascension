if you knew this would happen, why hasn't it happened sooner? Ksena asked the ancient exasperated

I can only interact with other ascendant, unless they could ascend by themselves I had no power, your ascension was incomplete but you are still an ascended, you where the first since the war to find me, and possibly the first ascendants not under their control since the end of the war, the ritual sites as well would only activate with an ascendant like yourself there

originally the sites would takes hundreds of us to gather to give it energy to transform into an ascendants, but instead, using your own ascension power even if it is incomplete was still enough to help him transform if he was ready.

he was ready? ascension is a special ritual for harnessing the power of the world, it's not for every person, children could be born into it but others must prove they are worthy first, by traveling with you, protecting you and learning to think for himself he was found worthy

Grandmother set the crystal tablet between them and let the silence settle before she spoke again.

"Worthiness was never about blood purity," she said. "It was about discipline under pressure. Your elders rewrote that into obedience because obedience is easier to govern."

Alcuin read the etched symbols twice, lips moving around old dialect forms he barely recognized. The tablet described ascension as a communal responsibility, not a crown. Those who rose were expected to protect the unascended, share training methods, and submit to rotating oversight. No hereditary council. No permanent ruling line.

Ksena felt sick and relieved at once. "Then everything in the city is built on theft."

"Yes," grandmother said. "And theft survives by forcing everyone else to defend it."

Kirk requested copies immediately, then suggested a distribution protocol that assumed interception. They split the record into fragments and assigned each courier only one section, with assembly instructions held by three separate contacts in different regions.

By midnight, the first two riders were already gone.

Alcuin remained by the doorway, staring into the dark. "If this reaches people," he said, "they will ask why we waited so long."

Ksena tied the last wax seal herself. "Then we tell them the truth. We were running, then learning, then surviving. Now we are choosing."

Grandmother touched her wrist, a brief pressure that carried apology and pride in equal measure. "Truth does not arrive clean," she said. "It arrives contested. Prepare for that."

Ksena looked at the remaining packets stacked on the table and nodded. Revelation would not end the conflict. It would begin the next one, on ground where lies no longer held the center.
