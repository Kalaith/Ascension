Their first diplomatic mission wasn't to a palace. It was to a hole in the ground.

The Valley of Dust lay three days west of the sanctuary, a scar in the landscape where the rivers had dried up a century ago. The sun beat down on the cracked earth, baking the clay into a hard, unforgiving ceramic.

"This is going to go well," Alcuin muttered as they walked down the winding path into the ravine. Heat radiated off his new armored skin, but he didn't seem to sweat anymore.

"Kaelen respects strength," Grandmother said, matching his pace despite her limp. "And honesty. But mostly strength."

Ksena adjusted her cloak. She wasn't wearing City armor today. She wore traveling leathers and carried no visible weapon.

"We aren't here to fight," she reminded them. "We're here to offer."

"Offering looks like weakness to Kaelen," Alcuin countered. "He's seen offerings before. Usually followed by taxes or chains."

They reached the settlement perimeter. It wasn't a town so much as a fortress built into the cliff face. Caves served as homes, connected by rickety gantries and reinforced with scavenged metal.

Warning shots kicked up dust at their feet before they could announce themselves.

"That's close enough, sky-stealers!" a voice rang out from the rocks above.

Ksena held her ground. She raised empty hands.

"I am Ksena of the Fire Line. I come to speak with Kaelen. And I bring proof that the sky is broken."

"We know the sky is broken!" the guard yelled back. "We're the ones eating the dust it drops!"

"Let them pass," a deeper voice commanded.

An old man emerged from the shadows of the aqueduct arch. Kaelen looked like he was carved from the same sandstone as his home—weathered, hard, and unyielding. A massive war hammer rested on his shoulder, the head made from a recycled turbine gear.

He looked at Ksena, then at Alcuin, then at Grandmother.

"The exile. The traitor. And the ghost," Kaelen spat. "Quite a party."

"We are not traitors," Alcuin said, stepping forward. The ground trembled slightly under his boots.

Kaelen narrowed his eyes at the display. "Clever trick. What did you bury under the road? Blasting powder?"

"It is not a trick," Grandmother said. "It is the truth you were told didn't exist."

She gestured to Estele.

Estele didn't shout. She simply raised a hand, palm up. A small, perfect flame danced there, unsupported by fuel.

The guards on the ridge lowered their rifles slightly. Magic without crystals was a myth. A heresy.

Kaelen didn't flinch. He jumped down from the rock, landing with a heavy thud. He walked up to Alcuin, standing toe-to-toe with him.

"So you learned a parlor game," he sneered. "Does it fill bellies? Does it stop raids? Does it stop a hammer?"

He swung.

It wasn't a feint. It was a kill shot.

Alcuin didn't dodge. He caught the hammer handle with one hand.

The impact should have broken his arm. Instead, it made a sound like a gong being struck. Alcuin's boots sank two inches into the hard earth, but he didn't move.

Kaelen's eyes went wide. He tried to pull the hammer back. Alcuin held it fast.

"It stops raids," Alcuin said quietly. He shoved the hammer back, sending Kaelen stumbling.

"Permanent raids," Ksena interjected, stepping between them. "If we unite."

"Unite?" Kaelen laughed, rubbing his shoulder. "With who? The City that starved us? Or the sky-people who bomb us?"

"With us," Ksena said. "A new line. Neither City nor Tribe. Something stronger."

"Stronger?" Kaelen challenged. "Prove it."

As if summoned by the taunt, a scout horn blew from the eastern ridge.

"Raiders!"

Not City patrols. Scavengers. A rogue band that preyed on the weak settlements. Motors roared as a dozen hover-skiffs crested the dune, weapons mounted on rusted frames.

Kaelen turned, barking orders. "Defensive positions! Seal the lower tunnels! Man the turret!"

"No," Ksena said.

She stepped past him.

"What are you doing?" Kaelen demanded. "Get back inside the perimeter!"

"You asked for proof," Ksena said over her shoulder.

She looked at Alcuin and Estele.

"Formation Three."

They moved.

The raiders opened fire. Bullets chewed up the ground around them.

Alcuin slammed his hands into the earth.

A wall of rock, three meters high and thick as a fortress gate, erupted across the ravine entrance, blocking the raiders' charge. Two skiffs crashed into it, crumpling like tin cans.

"Up!" Ksena ordered.

Estele climbed the rock wall in three fluid motions, reaching the top. She spread her arms, and fire rained down—not lethal, but a curtain of heat that forced the remaining raiders back, encircling them.

Ksena walked through the center, finding a gap in the wall Alcuin had left for her.

The raider leader, a scarred man on a ragged hover-skiff, leveled a heavy repeater at her.

"What are you?" he screamed over the roar of the flames.

Ksena didn't dodge. She caught the first round in a kinetic shield, the bullet flattening against the air inches from her face with a ripple of blue light.

She flicked her wrist.

A pulse of kinetic energy hit the skiff. The engine sputtered and died, the fuel lines fused by heat. The vehicle dropped to the dirt.

"I am the warning," she said, her voice amplified by the canyon walls. "Leave. Or become dust."

The leader looked at his jammed gun, then at the wall of fire, then at the man made of stone standing behind her.

"Retreat!" he screamed.

The raiders didn't wait for a second offer. They dragged their wounded to the remaining skiffs and fled, abandoning their gear.

Ksena turned back to the settlement.

The silence was absolute.

Kaelen stood with his mouth open. The guards stared.

Ksena walked back up the path, the wall of rock sinking back into the earth at Alcuin's signal. The fire died down instantly at Estele's command.

She stopped in front of the Elder.

"That," she said quietly, "stops the raids."

Kaelen looked at the fleeing dust cloud, then at her. He looked at Alcuin, who was wiping dust from his uncut knuckles.

He spat on the ground again. But this time, he nodded.

"We talk inside," he said. He gestured to his guards. "Stand down. And someone get the girl a drink. The one who eats fire."

Ksena smiled. It wasn't a diplomatic smile. It was the smile of a general who had just won her first battle.

"We drink," she said. "Then we plan."
