Their first diplomatic mission wasn't to a palace. It was to a hole in the ground.

The Dust Clan lived in the shadow of the broken aqueduct, surviving on scavenged water and pure spite. Their Elder, Kaelen, had famously spit on the last City envoy who tried to tax them.

"This is going to go well," Alcuin muttered as they walked down the winding path into the ravine.

"Kaelen respects strength," Grandmother said, matching his pace despite her limp. "And honesty. But mostly strength."

Ksena adjusted her cloak. She wasn't wearing City armor today. She wore traveling leathers and carried no visible weapon.

"We aren't here to fight," she reminded them. "We're here to offer."

"Offering looks like weakness to Kaelen," Alcuin countered.

They reached the settlement perimeter. Warning shots kicked up dust at their feet before they could announce themselves.

"That's close enough, sky-stealers!" a voice rang out from the rocks above.

Ksena held her ground. She raised empty hands.

"I am Ksena of the Fire Line. I come to speak with Kaelen. And I bring proof that the sky is broken."

"We know the sky is broken!" the guard yelled back. "We're the ones eating the dust it drops!"

"Let them pass," a deeper voice commanded.

An old man emerged from the shadows of the aqueduct arch. Kaelen looked like he was carved from the same sandstone as his home—weathered, hard, and unyielding.

He looked at Ksena, then at Alcuin, then at Grandmother.

"The exile. The traitor. And the ghost," Kaelen spat. "Quite a party."

"We are not traitors," Alcuin said, stepping forward. The ground trembled slightly under his boots.

Kaelen narrowed his eyes at the display. "Clever trick. What did you bury under the road? Blasting powder?"

"It is not a trick," Grandmother said. "It is the truth you were told didn't exist."

She gestured to Estele.

Estele didn't shout. She simply raised a hand, palm up. A small, perfect flame danced there, unsupported by fuel.

The guards on the ridge lowered their rifles slightly. Magic without crystals was a myth. A heresy.

Kaelen didn't flinch.

"So you learned a parlor game," he sneered. "Does it fill bellies? Does it stop raids?"

"It stops the raids permanently," Ksena said. "If we unite."

"Unite?" Kaelen laughed. "With who? The City that starved us? Or the sky-people who bomb us?"

"With us," Ksena said. "A new line. Neither City nor Tribe. Something stronger."

"Stronger?" Kaelen challenged. "Prove it."

As if summoned by the taunt, a scout horn blew from the eastern ridge.

"Raiders!"

Not City patrols. Scavengers. A rogue band that preyed on the weak settlements.

Kaelen turned, barking orders. "Defensive positions! Seal the lower tunnels!"

"No," Ksena said.

She stepped past him.

"What are you doing?" Kaelen demanded. "Get back inside the perimeter!"

"You asked for proof," Ksena said over her shoulder.

She looked at Alcuin and Estele.

"Formation Three."

They moved.

Alcuin slammed his hands into the earth. A wall of rock erupted across the ravine entrance, blocking the raiders' charge.

Estele climbed the rock wall in three fluid motions, reaching the top. She spread her arms, and fire rained down—not lethal, but a curtain of heat that forced the raiders back.

Ksena walked through the center.

The raider leader, a scarred man on a ragged hover-skiff, leveled a heavy repeater at her.

"What are you?" he screamed over the roar of the flames.

Ksena didn't dodge. She caught the first round in a kinetic shield, the bullet flattening against the air inches from her face.

She flicked her wrist. The skiff's engine sputtered and died, the fuel lines fused by heat.

"I am the warning," she said, her voice amplified by the canyon walls. "Leave. Or become dust."

The raiders didn't wait for a second offer. They broke and ran, abandoning their gear.

Ksena turned back to the settlement.

The silence was absolute.

Kaelen stood with his mouth open. The guards stared.

Ksena walked back up the path, the wall of rock sinking back into the earth at Alcuin's signal.

She stopped in front of the Elder.

"That," she said quietly, "stops the raids."

Kaelen looked at the fleeing dust cloud, then at her.

He spat on the ground again. But this time, he nodded.

"We talk inside," he said. "And someone get the girl a drink."
