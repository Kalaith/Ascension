Their first diplomatic mission wasn't to a palace. It was to a siege.

The Valley of Dust lay three days west of the sanctuary. As they crested the final ridge, they didn't see a settlement. They saw smoke.

"Suppressing fire!" a voice echoed from the rocks below.

Bursts of kinetic rounds chewed up the canyon entrance. A dozen hover-skiffs circled the perimeter, mounting rusted heavy repeaters. Raiders. Scavengers pinning the locals inside their own caves.

"They're trapped," Alcuin said, watching a tracer round spark off the aqueduct.

"Not for long," Ksena said. She drew her sword. "We don't knock. We clear the door."

They dropped into the ravine from the high wall.

Formation Three.

Alcuin hit the ground first. He didn't tuck and roll. He landed like a meteor. The impact wave knocked two skiffs sideways, flipping them into the dust.

"Raiders!" a lookout screamed.

"No," Ksena yelled, sliding down the scree slope behind Alcuin. "Solutions!"

She hit the valley floor and didn't stop. A skiff turned its guns on her. She caught the first round in a kinetic shield, the bullet flattening against the air inches from her face.

She flicked her wrist.

A pulse of kinetic energy hit the skiff. The engine sputtered and died, the fuel lines fused by heat.

"Clear the line!" Estele shouted from the ridge above.

She spread her arms, and fire rained down—not lethal, but a curtain of heat that forced the remaining raiders back, breaking their circle.

The raider leader, a scarred man on a ragged hover-skiff, leveled a heavy repeater at Alcuin.

"What are you?" he screamed over the roar.

Alcuin ripped a boulder from the earth with a gesture and floated it above his head.

"We are the eviction notice," Alcuin growled.

He threw it.

The boulder crushed the skiff's engine block. The leader scrambled away, terrified.

"Retreat!"

The raiders didn't wait. They fled, abandoning their gear and their wounded.

Silence fell over the valley.

Ksena sheathed her sword and walked toward the settlement entrance, where a group of stunned locals were peering out from behind barricades.

An old man emerged. Kaelen. He looked at the burning skiffs, then at the three strangers.

"That," Ksena said, pointing to the retreating dust cloud, "stops the raids."

Kaelen lowered his war hammer. He spat on the ground.

"You saved us," he said, wary. "Why?"

"Because we need weapons," Ksena said. "And you know where to find them."

Kaelen looked at Grandmother, who was limping down the path behind them.

"The exile," he grunted. "I should have known."

"We talk inside," Grandmother said. "Before more come."

Inside the caves, the air was cool and smelled of sulfur. They sat at a rough table while Kaelen poured water.

"We aren't here to fight," Ksena reminded them. "We're here to offer."

"Offering looks like weakness to Kaelen typically," Alcuin muttered.

"Not today," Kaelen said. He looked at Alcuin's stone-hard skin. "Today offering looks like a rock to the face."

Ksena turned back to the settlement.

The silence was absolute.

Kaelen stood with his mouth open. The guards stared.

Ksena walked back up the path, the wall of rock sinking back into the earth at Alcuin's signal. The fire died down instantly at Estele's command.

She stopped in front of the Elder.

"That," she said quietly, "stops the raids."

Kaelen looked at the fleeing dust cloud, then at her. He looked at Alcuin, who was wiping dust from his uncut knuckles.

He spat on the ground again. But this time, he nodded.

"We talk inside," he said. He gestured to his guards. "Stand down. And someone get the girl a drink. The one who eats fire."

Ksena smiled. It wasn't a diplomatic smile. It was the smile of a general who had just won her first battle.

"We drink," she said. "Then we plan."
