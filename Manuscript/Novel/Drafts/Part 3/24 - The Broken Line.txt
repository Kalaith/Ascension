They didn't have long to celebrate the alliance.

Two days after the vault raid, the sky over the Valley of Dust turned black.

Not clouds. Smoke.

"Incoming!" the lookout screamed from the aqueduct.

Ksena was already moving. She felt the signature before she saw it. Sharp. Hot. Familiar.

"Kalani," she whispered.

A sphere of white fire slammed into the ridge, vaporizing the guard tower. Stone turned to magma in seconds.

The raiders hadn't been the threat. They were the bait.

"Defensive positions!" Kaelen roared, rallying his clan. "Get the civilians to the deep tunnels!"

Ksena sprinted to the ravine edge, Alcuin and Estele flanking her.

"She found us," Alcuin said grimly.

"She didn't come alone," Estele pointed.

Dropships descended through the smoke. Not the clumsy transports of the City Guard. These were sleek, interceptor-class hulls. Elite units.

And leading them, hovering without a harness, was Kalani.

She looked different. Her armor was gone, replaced by a gown of woven flame that flowed around her like water. Her hair floated in an updraft of her own making.

"Hello, sister," her voice projected across the valley, amplified by power.

"Kalani!" Ksena shouted. "Stand down! These are civilians!"

"They are collaborators," Kalani answered. "And you are a disease."

She raised a hand.

The aqueduct—the clan's lifeline, the ancient stone arch that had stood for a thousand years—groaned.

"No," Ksena gasped.

Kalani didn't fire a bolt. She simply *pushed*.

The massive stone structure cracked. Then it shattered. tons of masonry rained down on the settlement below.

"Hold it!" Ksena screamed.

She threw her hands up, catching a falling pillar with a kinetic shield. Alcuin grabbed another. Estele vaporized a shower of smaller debris.

But they couldn't catch it all.

Dust choked the air. Screams rose from the crush.

"You monster," Ksena breathed.

Kalani descended, landing lightly on a surviving outgrowth.

"I am clarity," she said. "Father wanted order. Grandfather wanted peace. I want purity."

She looked at the devastation with zero empathy.

"Surrender the crystals you stole," she commanded. "And I will make your deaths quick."

Ksena drew her sword—the physical blade she still carried.

"Come and take them."

The duel was jagged and fast.

Kalani was stronger. She had the City's core feeding her. But Ksena had the team.

Alcuin shifted the ground under Kalani's feet, throwing off her aim. Estele blinded her with flash-bang flares. Ksena closed the distance, using the chaos to strike.

Her blade met Kalani's flame-shield with a hiss of vaporizing steel.

"You fight like a rat," Kalani sneered, blasting Ksena back.

"Rats survive!" Ksena retorted, rolling to her feet.

"Not today."

Kalani gathered a charge that turned the air white. A kill-shot.

"She's overloading!" Grandmother shouted from the tunnel entrance. "She can't hold that!"

Kalani didn't care. She was going to burn the whole valley to get them.

"Alcuin! Calculations!" Ksena yelled.

"The fault line!" Alcuin shouted back. "Under the ridge!"

"Hit it!"

Alcuin slammed both fists into the ground. Ksena added her own force, driving a spike of kinetic energy into the geological weakness.

The cliff face above Kalani sheared off.

A landslide of rock buried her.

It wouldn't kill her. Ksena knew that. But it buried her fire.

"Retreat!" Ksena ordered. "Everyone! Into the tunnels! We leave the valley!"

They ran.

Behind them, the pile of rocks began to glow red. The heat was melting the stone.

Kalani screamed in rage, a sound that shook the earth.

Ksena didn't look back. She helped Kaelen carry a wounded child into the dark.

The alliance held. But the cost had just doubled.

And Kalani was no longer just a sister. She was a war.
