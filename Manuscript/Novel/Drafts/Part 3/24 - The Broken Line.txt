They didn't have long to celebrate the alliance.

Two days after the vault raid, the sky over the Valley of Dust turned black.

It started with the birds. The carrion eaters that circled the cliffs suddenly peeled away, screeching. Then the wind died. The constant whistle of the canyon vanished, replaced by a heavy, suffocating silence.

"Incoming!" the lookout screamed from the aqueduct.

Ksena was already moving. She felt the signature before she saw it. Sharp. Hot. Familiar. It tasted like ozone and burned copper.

"Kalani," she whispered.

A sphere of white fire slammed into the ridge, vaporizing the guard tower. Stone turned to magma in seconds. There was no explosion sound at first—just the sudden absence of the tower—followed a heartbeat later by a thunderclap that knocked Ksena to her knees.

The raiders hadn't been the threat. They were the bait.

"Defensive positions!" Kaelen roared, rallying his clan. "Get the civilians to the deep tunnels!"

Ksena sprinted to the ravine edge, Alcuin and Estele flanking her.

"She found us," Alcuin said grimly.

"She didn't come alone," Estele pointed.

Dropships descended through the smoke. Not the clumsy transports of the City Guard. These were sleek, interceptor-class hulls. Elite units.

And leading them, hovering without a harness, was Kalani.

She looked different. Her armor was gone, replaced by a gown of woven flame that flowed around her like water. Her hair floated in an updraft of her own making. She looked like a goddess of destruction.

"Hello, sister," her voice projected across the valley, amplified by power.

"Kalani!" Ksena shouted. "Stand down! These are civilians!"

"They are collaborators," Kalani answered. "And you are a disease."

She raised a hand.

The aqueduct—the clan's lifeline, the ancient stone arch that had stood for a thousand years—groaned.

"No," Ksena gasped.

Kalani didn't fire a bolt. She simply *pushed*.

It happened in slow motion. The massive stone structure cracked in the center. Dust puffed out from the joints. Then, with a sound like the earth tearing apart, it shattered. Hundreds of tons of masonry rained down on the settlement below. The water pipes burst, sending a torrent of mud and stone into the homes carved into the cliffs.

"Hold it!" Ksena screamed.

She threw her hands up, catching a falling pillar with a kinetic shield. Alcuin grabbed another. Estele vaporized a shower of smaller debris.

But they couldn't catch it all. The kinetic force required ground Ksena's molars together. Blood trickled from her nose.

Dust choked the air. Screams rose from the crush. The sound of stone crushing bone.

"You monster," Ksena breathed.

Kalani descended, landing heavily. She didn't look triumphant. She looked exhausted.

"You are making this difficult, sister," she said. Her voice wasn't projected. It was just loud enough to be heard over the groaning rock. "Father wanted order. Grandfather wanted peace. I just want you to stop breaking things."

She looked at the devastation with a clinical eye.

"Surrender the crystals," she said, rubbing her temple. "I don't have time to chase you across the entire continent."

Ksena drew her sword—the physical blade she still carried.

"Come and take them."

The duel was jagged and fast.

Kalani was stronger. She had the City's core feeding her. But Ksena had the team.

Alcuin shifted the ground under Kalani's feet, throwing off her aim. Estele blinded her with flash-bang flares. Ksena closed the distance, using the chaos to strike.

Her blade met Kalani's flame-shield with a hiss of vaporizing steel. The heat was intense enough to singe Ksena's eyebrows.

"You fight like a child," Kalani snapped, blasting Ksena back. "Sloppy. Emotional."

"Rats survive!" Ksena retorted, rolling to her feet.

She launched a kinetic pulse, knocking Kalani back a step. Alcuin followed up with a barrage of stone spikes. Kalani shattered them with a wave of her hand, but she was stepping back.

"Enough," Kalani said.

She gathered a charge that turned the air white. The heat was unbearable. The rocks around her began to glow.

"She's overloading!" Grandmother shouted from the tunnel entrance. "She can't hold that! She'll vaporize the whole valley! The fault lines can't take that resonance!"

Kalani didn't care. She was going to burn the whole valley to get them.

"Alcuin! Calculations!" Ksena yelled.

"The fault line!" Alcuin shouted back. "Under the ridge!"

"Hit it!"

Alcuin slammed both fists into the ground. Ksena added her own force, driving a spike of kinetic energy into the geological weakness.

The cliff face above Kalani sheared off.

A landslide of rock buried her.

It wouldn't kill her. Ksena knew that. But it buried her fire.

"Retreat!" Ksena ordered. "Everyone! Into the tunnels! We leave the valley!"

They ran.

It was chaos. Dust blinded them. People were screaming, tripping over debris. The air in the tunnels was thick with panic.

"Move! Keep moving!" Kaelen shouted, shoving people forward. "Don't stop or you die!"

Ksena grabbed a child who was crying by a crushed cart. He was frozen, staring at the cave-in.

"Come on," she said, hoisting him onto her hip. "I've got you."

Behind them, the pile of rocks began to glow red. The heat was melting the stone.

Kalani screamed in rage, a sound that shook the earth.

Ksena didn't look back. She helped Kaelen carry a wounded Elder into the dark.

The alliance held. But the cost had just doubled.

And Kalani was no longer just a sister. She was a war.

As they stumbled deeper into the dark, Ksena felt the weight of the child in her arms. This wasn't a game of crystals and towers anymore. This was survival. And she wasn't sure if they had enough strength left to win.
