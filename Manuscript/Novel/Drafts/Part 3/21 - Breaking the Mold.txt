The news of Estele’s ascension didn't spread. It was a tactical secret.

Alcuin’s would be the statement.

"You realize what this means if it works," Ksena said, tightening the straps on his forearm bracers. They were in the open now, on a high plateau exposed to the wind and the watchful eyes of the stars.

"And if it fails?" Alcuin asked, his voice steady but his hands betraying a slight tremor.

"If it fails, we bury you and rewrite history," Ksena said bluntly. She wasn't going to lie to him. Not now.

He laughed. A short, sharp sound. "Comforting."

"Honest."

Alcuin looked out over the valley. The distant lights of the City were visible, a smear of gold against the dark horizon. He had spent his life looking at those lights as a threat. As a wall designed to keep him out.

"My blood isn't supposed to hold this," he said. "The stories say the Tribes are inherently grounded. Too much earth, not enough sky."

"The stories were written by the people inside the walls," Grandmother said, stepping into the circle of stones they had carried up the path. "They wrote history to justify their theft. Do not let their lies become your biology."

She held up the catalyst crystal. It wasn't the pure, clear stone they used for Estele. It was darker, flecked with iron. A raw geode they had pulled from the riverbed.

"This one is stubborn," Grandmother said. "Like you."

Alcuin took his place in the center.

The wind picked up.

"Ready?" Ksena asked.

Alcuin nodded.

This time, the connection felt different. With Estele, it had been a flow. With Alcuin, it was a fight.

As soon as they opened the channel, the energy bucked. It didn't want to enter him. It slammed against an invisible barrier inside his chest.

"Push!" Grandmother commanded.

Ksena gritted her teeth and shoved. It felt like trying to force water into stone. Resistance pushed back, hard and angry.

Alcuin cried out. He fell to his knees, clutching his ribs.

"It's rejecting him!" Estele shouted from her anchor point. "The frequency is wrong!"

"He is rejecting it!" Grandmother yelled. "Alcuin! Stop believing them! Stop believing you are less!"

Alcuin looked up. His eyes were wide with pain. Veins blackened on his neck.

"I... can't..." he gasped.

"You can!" Ksena stepped out of her anchor position—breaking protocol—and grabbed his shoulder. "Look at me! Look at who is holding you! Not a City guard! Not a priest! Me! Your friend! We are the same!"

The contact shocked them both.

Ksena poured her own power directly into him, bypassing the ritual circle. Raw, unfiltered connection.

It wasn't elegant. It was a breach.

Alcuin screamed.

The plateau lit up. A column of earth and fire erupted around them, blasting dust into the sky.

Ksena was thrown back, landing hard on the rocks.

Silence fell.

Dust hung in the air.

Slowly, the figure in the center stood up.

He wasn't glowing like Estele. He looked... solid. Dense. The air around him shimmered with heat haze, distorting the light.

Alcuin looked at his hands. They were covered in soot, but beneath the grime, his skin looked harder. Like tempered iron.

He clenched a fist.

A boulder five meters away cracked down the center.

He unclenched it.

The dust settled instantly, obeying gravity with terrifying speed.

"Earth and sky," Grandmother whispered, her eyes wide. "He didn't just take the fire. He grounded it."

Alcuin turned to Ksena. His expression was one of profound shock.

"It didn't burn me," he said. "It... integrated."

Ksena got to her feet, bruising already forming on her side.

"See?" she managed a smile. "Told you we were the same."

Alcuin looked at the City lights again. This time, they didn't look like a wall. They looked like a target.

"No," he said, his voice resonating with the weight of shifting stone. "We aren't the same. They just build high. I build deep."

He stomped the ground. A tremor ran through the plateau, shaking pebbles loose.

"Let them come," he said. "I am the mountain now."
