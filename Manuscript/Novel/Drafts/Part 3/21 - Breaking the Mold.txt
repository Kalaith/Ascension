The news of Estele’s ascension didn't spread. It was a tactical secret. To the outside world, she was still just a refugee.

But inside the camp, everything had shifted.

Alcuin sat on a rock overlooking the valley, watching Estele practice below. She was juggling fireballs, laughing as they wove complex patterns in the air. She looked light. Free.

Alcuin felt heavy.

"You realize what this means if it works," Ksena said, stepping up beside him. She was tightening the straps on his forearm bracers. They were in the open now, on a high plateau exposed to the wind and the watchful eyes of the stars.

"And if it fails?" Alcuin asked, his voice steady but his hands betraying a slight tremor.

"If it fails, we bury you and rewrite history," Ksena said bluntly. She wasn't going to lie to him. Not now.

He laughed. A short, sharp sound. "Comforting."

"Honest."

Alcuin looked out over the valley. The distant lights of the City were visible, a smear of gold against the dark horizon. He had spent his life looking at those lights as a threat. As a wall designed to keep him out.

He remembered being six years old, watching the City Guard march through his village. He remembered the feeling of being small, of being made of mud while they were made of light. *Earth-bound*, they called him. *Dirt-blood*.

"My blood isn't supposed to hold this," he said. "The stories say the Tribes are inherently grounded. Too much earth, not enough sky. We are meant to be the foundation, not the spire."

"The stories were written by the people inside the walls," Grandmother said, stepping into the circle of stones they had carried up the path. "They wrote history to justify their theft. Do not let their lies become your biology."

She held up the catalyst crystal. It wasn't the pure, clear stone they used for Estele. It was darker, flecked with iron. A raw geode they had pulled from the riverbed.

"This one is stubborn," Grandmother said. "Like you."

Alcuin took his place in the center. He looked at the geode. It didn't sparkle. It absorbed the light.

"Ready?" Ksena asked.

Alcuin nodded. He closed his eyes.

The wind picked up, whipping his hair across his face.

"Begin."

This time, the connection felt different. With Estele, it had been a flow, a river rushing to the sea. With Alcuin, it was a collision.

As soon as they opened the channel, the energy bucked. It didn't want to enter him. It slammed against an invisible barrier inside his chest.

"Push!" Grandmother commanded.

Ksena gritted her teeth and shoved. It felt like trying to force water into stone. Resistance pushed back, hard and angry.

Alcuin cried out. He fell to his knees, clutching his ribs. He felt like he was being crushed. The pressure wasn't expanding him; it was compressing him.

"It's rejecting him!" Estele shouted from her anchor point. "The frequency is wrong! It's too volatile!"

"He is rejecting it!" Grandmother yelled. "Alcuin! Stop believing them! Stop believing you are less!"

Alcuin couldn't speak. He was drowning in gravity. Every doubt he had ever felt—every sneer from a guard, every moment of feeling slow and heavy—was manifesting as physical weight. *You are dirt*, the voice in his head whispered. *Dirt doesn't fly.*

"I... can't..." he gasped.

"You can!" Ksena stepped out of her anchor position—breaking protocol—and grabbed his shoulder.

The shockwave hit her, but she held on.

"Look at me!" she screamed. "Look at who is holding you! Not a City guard! Not a priest! Me! Your friend! We are the same!"

The contact shocked them both.

Ksena poured her own power directly into him, bypassing the ritual circle. Raw, unfiltered connection.

It wasn't elegant. It was a breach.

Alcuin screamed.

The plateau lit up. A column of earth and fire erupted around them, blasting dust into the sky.

Ksena was thrown back, landing hard on the rocks.

Silence fell.

Dust hung in the air, thick and choking.

Slowly, the figure in the center stood up.

He wasn't glowing like Estele. He didn't radiate light. He looked... solid. Dense. The air around him shimmered with heat haze, distorting the light, bending it around gravity wells that shouldn't exist.

Alcuin looked at his hands. They were covered in soot, but beneath the grime, his skin looked harder. Like tempered iron. He sought the panic, the fear, but found only a deep, resonant stillness.

He clenched a fist.

The sound was like a hammer hitting an anvil. A boulder five meters away cracked down the center.

He unclenched it.

The dust settled instantly, obeying gravity with terrifying speed.

"Earth and sky," Grandmother whispered, her eyes wide. "He didn't just take the fire. He grounded it."

Alcuin turned to Ksena. His expression was one of profound shock.

"It didn't burn me," he said. His voice was deeper, vibrating in Ksena's chest. "It... integrated. It feels heavy. But good heavy. Like armor."

Ksena got to her feet, bruising already forming on her side.

"See?" she managed a smile. "Told you we were the same."

Alcuin looked at the City lights again. This time, they didn't look like a wall. They looked like a target.

"No," he said, his voice resonating with the weight of shifting stone. "We aren't the same. They build high. I build deep."

He stomped the ground. A tremor ran through the plateau, shaking pebbles loose.

Estele walked over, looking at him with curiosity. She reached out a hand, wreathed in flame. Alcuin met it with his own hand. The fire washed over his skin and... stopped. It didn't burn. It just sat there, absorbed.

"I'm the spark," Estele said, realizing it.

"And I'm the hearth," Alcuin finished.

"Let them come," he said, looking at the distant city. "I am the mountain now."

Grandmother stepped forward, leaning on her cane which was now cracked down the middle.

"The mountain needs to move," she said. "We have an army to build. And now, we have the foundation."
