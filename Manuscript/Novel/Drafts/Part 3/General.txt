The general went over his plans multiple times, was this a mistake to get involved in he thought to himself, their mission had been to respond to a distress beacon, and see if they can be of help in either diplomacy or combat.
The problem was they arrived to late for the war that had ended over a thousand years ago, and the current fight was closer to a civil war, should they be involved in it, the current situation was, after the war the people on the planet had split into two factions, one faction was the reason the war went in their favor, but after-wards they waged war on their own people and by the end of it they won and civilization collapsed for the original species, the winner went off and mostly stayed in their city, but they did take steps to control the population and more one report of mass genocide.
His own people had failed to make contact with the race for any sort of negotiation, and they had come under attack by them more once.

By siding with the oppressed side, if they helped them win eventually they would raise their technology back up to space, the other side seem content to stay in there city.
If they just let the other people live their lives there wouldn’t be a problem, but the leadership of the city seemed bent on having it there way.

It was a difficult decision for the general, at least the female Ksena had been understanding, it was her people that was affected and she understood his concerns, but the decision was the general’s and in this case he had decided to side with Ksena, the thing that moved him was the fact that the people in the city were being controlled by a few select individuals, if the general could help Ksena oust the current leadership, that would be enough what they did after that is there decision

The other factor was the fact that it was not a full scale war, just a distraction, give Ksena and her people time to implement their plan for removing the control, so in terms of life's loss, it will be zero, he wasn’t going to fight to kill and he would do his best to make sure none of his own people fell either

The plan was quite simple, there barrier was quiet impervious, but a light barrage on one side to distract from the team entering the other side, and full retreat hopefully by the time they realized the ship would be gone and the party secure inside the building, the plan seemed save and reliable, although Ksena was a little vague on breaking the mind control, the general didn’t think she had an idea on what to do, but it was her problem to deal with.

Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.

Kirk insisted on one final comms test before committing the plan. The first two signals failed in the lower basin. The third worked only after they moved twenty meters up-slope. That small correction would have cost them the whole operation if discovered mid-action.

Kirk ran a final signal test from three elevations and logged the only reliable relay point. It was exposed, narrow, and non-negotiable. Alcuin marked the approach with two removable stones while Ksena timed the climb under full gear. "Ugly," she said when they were done. "Usable," Kirk answered. That became the standard for the rest of planning.

The final board showed fewer options than before, but every remaining option was executable.
