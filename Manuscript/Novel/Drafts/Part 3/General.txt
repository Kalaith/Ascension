The general went over his plans multiple times, was this a mistake to get involved in he thought to himself, their mission had been to respond to a distress beacon, and see if they can be of help in either diplomacy or combat.
The problem was they arrived to late for the war that had ended over a thousand years ago, and the current fight was closer to a civil war, should they be involved in it, the current situation was, after the war the people on the planet had split into two factions, one faction was the reason the war went in their favor, but after-wards they waged war on their own people and by the end of it they won and civilization collapsed for the original species, the winner went off and mostly stayed in their city, but they did take steps to control the population and more one report of mass genocide.
His own people had failed to make contact with the race for any sort of negotiation, and they had come under attack by them more once.

By siding with the oppressed side, if they helped them win eventually they would raise their technology back up to space, the other side seem content to stay in there city.
If they just let the other people live their lives there wouldn’t be a problem, but the leadership of the city seemed bent on having it there way.

It was a difficult decision for the general, at least the female Ksena had been understanding, it was her people that was affected and she understood his concerns, but the decision was the general’s and in this case he had decided to side with Ksena, the thing that moved him was the fact that the people in the city were being controlled by a few select individuals, if the general could help Ksena oust the current leadership, that would be enough what they did after that is there decision

The other factor was the fact that it was not a full scale war, just a distraction, give Ksena and her people time to implement their plan for removing the control, so in terms of life's loss, it will be zero, he wasn’t going to fight to kill and he would do his best to make sure none of his own people fell either

The plan was quite simple, there barrier was quiet impervious, but a light barrage on one side to distract from the team entering the other side, and full retreat hopefully by the time they realized the ship would be gone and the party secure inside the building, the plan seemed save and reliable, although Ksena was a little vague on breaking the mind control, the general didn’t think she had an idea on what to do, but it was her problem to deal with.

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

 Open ground meant speed but exposure. Broken ridges meant concealment but fatigue. Old roads meant faster travel but predictable ambush points. They adjusted route selection based on weather and patrol rhythm, not pride. If the safer line cost half a day, they paid it. If a village contact looked compromised, they cut communication and moved. Hard choices stopped feeling exceptional. They became the baseline rhythm of moving through contested territory.

 Missed signals, unclear hand marks, and assumptions about who had visual contact were all corrected. They standardized spacing by terrain type and set new no-call rules during high-risk crossings. Small improvements like that prevented cascading mistakes later. It was unglamorous work, but it turned chaos into repeatable movement, and repeatable movement meant survivability.

 They listed what was confirmed, what was likely, and what was still dangerous guesswork. Then they decided the next movement window and who carried what risk. That process kept arguments from expanding into paralysis. When tensions flared, they redirected to tasks: perimeter checks, route sketches, ration control, and fallback markers. It was not heroic, but it kept people alive. 

 Some wounds demanded action, but acting at the wrong time could destroy everything they had built. Ksena began stopping herself before rushing the most painful target. Alcuin stopped assuming delay was cowardice. Kirk stopped pushing for clean mission closure and started backing phased goals instead. The team did not become calm. They became deliberate, and that was better.

 At first they were surviving exile. Now they were shaping a response to systems that had lasted for generations. That required more than courage. It required evidence, timing, and enough allies to hold the line when retaliation came. Every conversation with locals, every recovered record, every successful withdrawal without losses moved them one step closer to that threshold. 

 Ksena still carried anger toward the city, Alcuin still carried doubt about what they were becoming, and Kirk still carried mission pressure from a world that expected clean answers. None of those burdens were solved in one night. But they started speaking about them before the next march, which prevented silent fractures later. In a campaign built on partial trust, honest discomfort was more useful than polite silence.

 They had enough proof to challenge old narratives, enough power to defend themselves in a limited fight, and enough scars to avoid easy traps. That was not victory. It was readiness. The next chapter would demand more from all of them, but they entered it with clearer roles and fewer fantasies.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.

At midday they paused in a shallow cut between broken slabs and checked gear in silence. Water levels were lower than planned. Two ration packets had split at the seams. Kirk rerouted them around a patrol corridor he had tracked from air notes, while Alcuin marked a fallback path into the ravine if they were forced to drop from sight fast. Ksena copied both routes onto cloth so no single person carried the whole plan.
