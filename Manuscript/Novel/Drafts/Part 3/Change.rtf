\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 the power not only coursed through him, it changed him, Ksena full ascension was overtaken has all eyes turned to face him, as the power coursed through his body, his frame started to compress, his skin grew smooth and darked getting closer to a deep purple, his face changed to being more sculptured and refined and his eyes grew brighter, by the end of it his body wrapped in power, he could have been mistaken as Ksena brother and not as a different species}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ksena realized this was the truth, they where not two different people, after they had managed to repeal the ancient invaders the ascended had somehow been turned against there own race, there was only one true face and by going  through the ritual with her, he had reached it, the ancient had known all along that this would have happened}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 now with his ascension done others from his race would do it as well, the elders were losing control this is what they had tried to hide, why they had committed these atrocities they wanted to stop them from being able to ascend and oppose them}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Every time they felt one was getting close they would attack and destroy the entire village and remove all trace of it, they had likely only kept them around so they where not guilty of wiping out there forefathers and so they could continue to use them as labor.}}
