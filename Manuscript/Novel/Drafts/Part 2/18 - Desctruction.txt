the village didn't exist now, where once stood a proud tribe was nothing but a depression in the ground and the charred remains of houses, animals and bodies, what had caused this, was it the ships she had seen in the sky are they the real ancient enemy had they come to invade and take another go at destroying their people, Ksena spent the day with Alcuin helping to bury the dead, they had at least found some shovels buried under the rubble to help them; the task brought them a little closer together, him because she was helping to bury the dead, and her because he let her work beside him,
after saying their prayers they both headed off, they were tired and needed to make camp, but unspoken they didn't want to do this near the village, only when they were well passed did they collapse, they didn't even get a fire lit for food, neither had an appetite 
they collapsed and sleep well into the following morning


The focus stayed on the destroyed village aftermath and shared burial labor. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on the destroyed village aftermath and shared burial labor. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on the destroyed village aftermath and shared burial labor. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on the destroyed village aftermath and shared burial labor. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on the destroyed village aftermath and shared burial labor. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.
