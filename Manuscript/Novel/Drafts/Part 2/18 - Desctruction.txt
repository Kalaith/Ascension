the village didn't exist now, where once stood a proud tribe was nothing but a depression in the ground and the charred remains of houses, animals and bodies, what had caused this, was it the ships she had seen in the sky are they the real ancient enemy had they come to invade and take another go at destroying their people, Ksena spent the day with Alcuin helping to bury the dead, they had at least found some shovels buried under the rubble to help them; the task brought them a little closer together, him because she was helping to bury the dead, and her because he let her work beside him,

after saying their prayers they both headed off, they were tired and needed to make camp, but unspoken they didn't want to do this near the village, only when they were we'll passed did they collapse, they didn't even get a fire lit for food, neither had an appetite

they collapsed and sleep we'll into the following morning

By the time they finished burying the last body, both of them were shaking from exhaustion.

Ksena planted a marker stone at the edge of the ruined square and swore she would return with names, not rumors. Alcuin did not promise comfort. He promised movement. They left before sunset carrying less food, less certainty, and one shared conclusion: whatever was happening between the city and the ritual was larger than any single attack.
