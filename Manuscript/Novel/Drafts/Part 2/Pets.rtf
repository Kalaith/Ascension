It was a cat; it went hunting for food at night; they were rare, Ksena or Alcuin had never seen one in person before, Ksena had only seen them in books, they added onto the fire trying to scare it away, but as the fire grew it crawled in closer, they could clearly see its bright orange fur, scarlet in the fires ruddy glow}

The cat wore the flame as a coat of amour; the explosion dissipated after the cat left it, leaving Ksena and Alcuin alone with the cat that was now preening itself sitting between them}}
