The general looked over the reports, and out the widow of his ship to the planet below, it was a strange planet, while it had a civilization older than humans, a species that already had ships stronger and faster than anything the humans had, the species was not actually space faring; they had everything they needed to leave the stars and beyond but didn't act on it, instead staying in one advanced city, but this planet was sending out a distress signal asking for help, and the distress signal came not from the advanced city, it came from the species on the planet that looked like it was still in the hunter/gather relationship apart from one large city where the signal was coming from; the scientist estimated that the signal has actually been sent out for at least a few hundred years, so what had happened, a secondary uprising perhaps? and the other city eventually moved. This was supported in that the cities had close structural relationships, but the hunters' city was much older.

Humans had found the signal, as the first sign of intelligent life humans had gone into an euphoria of waiting to answer it, first interaction and helping while at it, but now the situation was more confusing.. and the general had a media appointment at 15:00 hours to report on the state of things, but this didn't appear to be a clear-cut situation, interacting with a species that was not seafaring, but it's where the signal originated from, but it was old but based on the distress signal had also taught them the language and the hunter/gather spoke a version.

They would need to make contact discreetly, maybe something had happened, and they had been attacked and was under some threat that stopped them, the other city was under a shield, that made their own shields seem childish, the scientist reported that all the ships guns could be fired and not even dent the shield so he doubted they would be the ones to visit first

General Hale ended the briefing with one rule: no operation proceeded without a civilian extraction path.

Kirk argued for speed. Ksena argued for precision. Hale forced both into the same timeline and signed off only when the plan had fallback windows for failure. It was slower than anyone wanted, but it was the first plan in weeks designed to survive first contact with reality.

Kirk flew his jet from the spaceship they had arrived in, he was on scouting duty they had come to this planet to help the natives, but where was still a bit of an unknown, they had a city on radar, so his first job was to find this city and report back on the outcome, was the signal coming from it, was there signs of war.

At the moment this planet didn't seem that advanced, they had found satellites long since abandoned and destroyed, Kirk doubted if anything happened it happened recently, and maybe they had come too later, they had to find small tribes but as far as Kirk could see they hadn't made it as far as agriculture, this mission was likely a waste of time

'Warning' a warning came up on Kirks screen, there was something coming at him and fast, it was a.. Fireball 'oh shit' kirk exclaimed it was too late to dodge and he hid the eject button, not a moment to soon before his plane exploded and his seat was sent flying, kirk grabbed with his parachute as he tumbled through the air, given it a yank he gripped the seat as the parachute unveiled and pulled out, once it was stable Kirk looked around, trying to work out if what had shot if was still around and who was it.. So much for being peaceful, he said. What looked like a girl floating in the air, shaking his head to see if it was a mirage. The girl, it was a girl, was coated and flames and seemed to be suspended in the air.

Whoever it was, she was laughing at him, or what he assumed was laughter, before flying off, Kirk was thankful if that's who destroyed his ship hadn't thrown another one at him while he was a sitting duck in the sky, but it was silly to keep him alive, he would get his revenge on her somehow

She must have left him alive, so he could go back to his people and let them know she had destroyed the ship, it wouldn't work, if she thought that was enough to scare them off, they had come here and going home wouldn't happen easily, but now he knew the enemy and that this world was truly dangerous, it wouldn't happen a second time.

Finally, coming in for landing, Kirk gathered his things. The seat included enemy gear, and he still had his radio available

'Base, come in this is kirk, flight 083' 'Kirk this is headquarters, what happened your flight disappeared of the radar'

'I was attacked, the ship was destroyed, I got out in time'

'We saw nothing else on the radar'

'The projectile seemed to come from a humanoid form and not a plane'

'A humanoid was on the ground and shot you down. Do you need an emergency evacuation?'

'No, it seems the inhabitants here have a form of flight. After shooting me down, she headed north-east'

'Kirk repeat, you saw a flying humanoid female who shot down your ship?

'That's correct, she was around 5'6, dark purple skin, female appearance. I didn't catch her name though'

'I am going to find the wreckage of my ship and see if I can get more supplies, and either continue towards the beacon location or head back'

'Please head back to the ship, if there is aggressive inhabits we will need to get more data and plan'

'Negative, I will continue to get more information. I'll activate my beacon if I get in trouble'

' Sigh, be careful out there, and report any information. We are blind here'

'Will do; kirk replied and turned his communicator off. Time to head towards the plane crash. He could see the smoke from here.

Kirk's recon pass ended with smoke in the cockpit and a forced descent two ridges west of target.

He walked out with bruised ribs, a damaged jet, and clear visuals of hostile aerial units already inside the theater. By the time he reached allied lines, he had one conclusion ready for command: this mission was no longer reconnaissance. It was active conflict with an enemy that had studied the same sky for generations.

Giant balls of fire approached from the skies, as they got closer ships emerged from the fire, Ksena had never heard of anything like this, Ksena couldn't tell what the ship was made off, but it was massive, nearly bigger than the city of her birth, Alcuin also stared at the ship slack jawed, it must be even more of a surprise for him, he hadn't seen a lot of technology in the tribe if any, and this ship was raining fire from the skies as it came down, at least it was far away, Ksena mumbled, but we should head further away

Alcuin nodded and actually started into a small trot, Ksena kept up with him, but she hoped he didn't want to keep up this pace for long, the outside world was so tiring, with all the walking and dangers and now giant ship coming out of the sky, why was this all happening now, and why did she have to be a part of it.

Of course maybe these were the ancient enemy all along, maybe they had somehow stopped the ritual and now coming, Ksena shivered whoever was in the ship would be as advanced or more than her own people, did they come as friend or foe, her only choice was to follow what the ancient said and get her ascension ritual done, if it worked she would have a way of fighting, regardless of who the enemy was even if her family was controlled she would save and protect them

They climbed to a low ridge and watched the ships descend until the last fire trail faded from the sky. No banner, no broadcast, no clear sign of intent.

"We observe first," Alcuin said. "No contact until we understand who controls the ground."

Ksena nodded, eyes still fixed on the horizon.

Whatever had arrived, it had changed the board. From this point on, every step had to be chosen, not improvised.

Kirk woke to smoke, pain, and alarm tone.

The escape pod had carved a trench into red stone before stopping nose-down in scrub. Half the guidance panel was dead. Long-range comms were gone. So was any chance of quick extraction.

He had maybe twenty minutes before daylight made him obvious.

Then he saw movement below the ridge.

Two locals. One female, one male. Both armed. Both moving like fighters.

He raised his hands and called through external speaker in slow trade-standard.

"Do not fire. I am not hostile."

The answer was a flame strike that scorched the pod hull.

"All right," Kirk muttered. "Negotiation later."

The male charged first. Kirk fired a sedative dart to center mass, then a second when momentum kept him coming. The female drew flame around her hands. He hit her shoulder with one dart and leg with another before she could release.

Both went down hard.

He waited thirty seconds, checked reflexes, and moved.

Dragging two unconscious aliens into shade by himself took longer than he wanted. The male was heavier than he looked. The female was lighter but had burn-hot skin for several minutes after sedation, like her nervous system was still trying to ignite.

Kirk bound wrists and ankles with restraint cord, then set camp twenty paces away where he could watch both.

He kept his sidearm in reach.

The male woke first, rolled, and tested bindings with practiced force.

Kirk switched on his field translator.

"Hello," he said.

The male froze, then stared at him with open hostility and careful curiosity.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Kirk Hale. Human expeditionary scout." Kirk nodded toward the female. "I removed her gag only if we can talk without fire."

"Release us," the male said. "You attacked us."

"You attacked me first."

The male looked toward his companion and then back.

"She is not the one who destroyed your ship," he said. "That was an ascended."

Kirk held his expression neutral, though the distinction landed.

"You are saying same species, different actor."

"Yes."

Kirk considered for a second, then removed the female's mouth binding and stepped back.

She inhaled once, hard, and fixed him with a glare sharp enough to cut.

"Who did you come to help?" she asked. "A village burned near here. Was that your doing?"

"No," Kirk said. "I hit only you two with sedative darts. Nothing else."

"Then who burned it?"

"A woman who looked like you," he said. "Same phenotype. More power output. She destroyed my shuttle in under six seconds."

The female flinched.

"My sister," she said under her breath.

Silence followed.

Kirk broke it with mission context.

"We intercepted an old distress beacon from this world. Message requested assistance against an external threat. Transit took six years. We arrived to fragmented societies, no unified command, and active hostilities we do not yet understand."

The male frowned. "Six years?"

"One-way," Kirk said. "No live link home."

The female sat straighter despite restraints.

"The war in our records ended centuries ago," she said. "If your beacon is from that era, then someone or something kept it transmitting."

Kirk nodded. "Exactly why I need information before I decide who is attacking whom."

The male gave him a long measuring look.

"My name is Alcuin," he said. "This is Ksena. We were exiled from different factions. We are not your enemy unless you make us one."

Kirk almost smiled.

""

Ksena's mouth twitched despite herself.

"Then untie us and prove you mean it."

Kirk did not do it immediately.

He asked five more questions first: known safe routes, current faction boundaries, nearest settlements, observed aerial threats, and whether either had direct control over large armed groups.

Answers were messy but consistent.

No obvious deception markers.

He cut their restraints.

Alcuin rubbed his wrists and did not rush him. Ksena stood slowly, eyes still wary.

"You tranquilized us hard," she said.

"You tried to incinerate me," Kirk replied.

"Fair."

By full daylight they had shifted from captor and prisoners to three exhausted survivors with overlapping problems.

Kirk shared rations and a topographic overlay. Ksena marked ritual sites. Alcuin marked hunter paths and danger zones. The map between them became the first real agreement.

Before they moved, Kirk tapped a damaged comm unit and looked toward the horizon where smoke from his shuttle still drifted.

"My team will assume I am dead unless I reach relay range," he said. "Until then, we are operating off trust and necessity."

Alcuin checked his knife edge and nodded.

"Then walk with us. We have both."
