The city was amazing.

Everywhere Ksena looked, the architecture held echoes of her own home and yet nothing matched exactly. Streets were wider. Towers were shorter but thicker. Gardens were not ornamental circles of curated flowers; they were working terraces full of vegetables, fruit trees, and irrigation channels.

"This is what a city looks like when it expects hunger," Alcuin said.

Ksena nodded slowly. "Mine expects control."

They stood on a ridge above the gates for several minutes, watching movement patterns before approaching. Carts came and went in steady intervals. Children ran messages between market rows. Guard rotations looked disciplined but not oppressive.

"No barrier," Ksena said.

"No need for one if your people trust each other," Alcuin replied.

She wasn't sure whether that was admiration or accusation.

At the outer gate, two guards crossed spears.

"Halt. Identify yourselves and state purpose."

Alcuin stepped forward. "Travelers. We came from the plains ruins and request temporary entry for supply and records inquiry."

The lead guard's eyes moved to Ksena and narrowed. "Ascendant."

"Exiled ascendant," Ksena said before Alcuin could soften it.

"Exile from where?"

"South city."

The second guard cursed under his breath.

"We've had enough of south city trouble," he said.

The lead guard kept his tone formal. "Regardless, you'll come with us for screening. No open flames inside gates. No flight. No unsupervised access to administrative district."

"Understood," Alcuin said.

"Weapons peace-tied."

They complied.

Inside the gatehouse, a clerk recorded names, origin claims, and declared affiliations. Ksena had never been processed like this before. In her own city, birth line replaced paperwork.

"Any active warrants?" the clerk asked.

Ksena hesitated. "Not here."

The clerk gave her a long look, then wrote anyway.

They were assigned a holding guide named Ressa, a practical woman in worn leather with city insignia stitched at the shoulder.

"You get one day permit," Ressa said while leading them into the main district. "Renewable if no incidents. Start with market and lodging. If you want archives, request through me."

"Why so strict?" Alcuin asked.

Ressa glanced back. "Because the last unregistered ascendant visitor tried to start a sermon about blood purity in a grain queue."

Ksena winced.

The market stunned her more than the gate had. Metalwork stalls beside seed exchanges. Animal harness makers beside dye sellers. Public kitchens feeding workers by shift tokens. People argued loudly and moved on without formal penalties.

Freedom looked messy.

"Your city would call this chaos," Alcuin said, reading her expression.

"My city calls anything unscripted chaos," Ksena replied.

They rented a narrow room above a baker's shop and spent midday gathering information. Most people avoided discussing the southern ascendant city directly, but when shown a copied map fragment from the ruins, several older traders recognized landmark names.

"You want the civic historian," one said. "If anyone still remembers council split records, it's him."

Ressa arranged the meeting for dusk.

The historian, Master Halven, lived in a tower lined with rolled paper records and clay tablets. He peered at them over tiny spectacles and listened without interrupting while Ksena described the ruined city and the projection memory of ancient conflict.

When she finished, he sat back slowly.

"You've walked into old fractures," he said. "Most people avoid those."

"Can you confirm the collapse cause?" Alcuin asked.

Halven nodded toward a shelf. "I can confirm there were multiple causes. External attack pressure, yes, but also internal power conflict and ritual doctrine schism."

Ksena's chest tightened. "So it wasn't one enemy."

"History rarely is," Halven said.

He retrieved a ledger and opened to a marked page.

"This city," he said, tapping the margin, "was founded by coalition survivors who rejected centralized ascendant ritual control after the split. That's why our design resembles your home while differing in priorities. We copied what worked, then changed what destroyed us."

Ksena stared at the page.

"Why was this never taught?"

Halven gave her a sad look. "Because your city and ours stopped sharing teachers centuries ago."

They spent two hours reviewing maps and references. Halven provided copies of route notes to nearby temple clusters and one warning in bold ink:

"Avoid district of glass plains during high sun. Residual heat fractures remain active."

When they left the tower, full dark had fallen.

On the walk back to lodging, Ressa spoke for the first time in several minutes.

"You asked earlier why we screened hard," she said. "Now you know. Old history still kills people when handled badly."

Ksena nodded.

"Thank you for not treating us like enemies."

Ressa shrugged. "Haven't decided yet."

At the baker's room, Alcuin spread new notes on the floor.

"We got route updates, cause confirmation, and temple references," he said. "That's a good day."

"And proof my city lied by omission," Ksena added.

"Also true."

She sat by the window and watched lanterns move below in streets that kept functioning without barriers or control crystals.

This city was not perfect. Guards still watched. Records still filtered access. Fear still existed.

But it breathed.

No one had to pretend otherwise.

By dawn they renewed their permit and prepared to leave before gossip about their origin spread too far.

At the gate, Ressa handed Ksena a sealed note for Halven's counterpart in another district.

"If stopped, show this. It says you're annoying researchers, not spies."

Ksena smiled despite herself. "That's generous."

"Don't make me regret it," Ressa said.

They stepped back into open plains with heavier packs and clearer direction.

Behind them, the city gates closed and reopened for the next cart in line, because life there moved on by work, not ceremony.

Ksena looked back once.

"One day," she said, "I want mine to look more like that."

Alcuin adjusted his spear. "Then we'll survive long enough to make it happen."

They walked north toward the next marker on Halven's map.

For the first time since exile, Ksena felt not just anger at what she had lost, but a concrete image of what could be built instead.


The focus stayed on entry into the coalition city and practical governance differences. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on entry into the coalition city and practical governance differences. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on entry into the coalition city and practical governance differences. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on entry into the coalition city and practical governance differences. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on entry into the coalition city and practical governance differences. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.

They kept returning to entry rules and governance differences that challenged Ksena's assumptions, because delay now would only make the next confrontation worse.
