Alcuin felt the power flow through his body as Ksena completed the temple sequence, and for one frozen second he thought he had made a mistake standing so close.

He had whispered the words with her out of habit, half prayer and half mockery, expecting nothing except maybe comfort for her. Instead his skin prickled with heat and his muscles tightened like he had run all day uphill.

Ksena laughed in front of him, flames dancing around her wrists in bright loops as she tested what she could do now. She looked alive in a way he had not seen since before exile.

Alcuin forced himself to smile back.

"You did it," he said.

"Not all the way," Ksena replied, turning one palm and watching a thread of fire bloom between her fingers. "But it's different now. I can feel it listening."

Listening.

That word unsettled him.

He stepped away from the center platform and leaned against a cracked pillar until the dizziness passed. The temple air smelled like dust, old stone, and something metallic he could not name.

"Are you okay?" Ksena asked, noticing him at last.

"Fine," he lied.

She narrowed her eyes. "You look pale."

"I've looked like this my whole life."

"Alcuin."

He sighed and gave in by half. "Something happened when we spoke the words. I felt... pressure. Not pain. Just pressure."

Ksena's expression shifted from joy to concern.

"Like the ritual?"

"No. Different. Yours looked like drowning in light. This felt like standing near a forge too long."

She walked closer and held out her hand. "Let me feel your pulse."

"You're not a healer."

"Neither are you. Hand."

He gave it to her.

Her fingers we're warm, warmer than they should have been. She counted silently, then frowned.

"It's fast."

"Could be fear."

"Are you afraid?"

"Yes," he said, surprising both of them with the honesty.

Ksena did not let go immediately.

"Me too," she said quietly.

They stood like that in the dead temple, two exiles in a room built by people who had expected history to remember them.

When she released his hand, Alcuin flexed his fingers and saw, just for an instant, a faint orange spark at his knuckles.

He jerked his hand back.

"Did you see that?"

"See what?"

"Nothing."

He hated how quickly he said it.

Ksena crossed her arms. "We don't hide things from each other anymore."

"I know."

"Then?"

He exhaled. "I thought I saw a spark. Might have been reflection from your flames."

Ksena glanced at his hand, then at the scorched marks in the stone around the altar.

"The projection said power transfer was possible," she said. "Maybe that wasn't just history."

"I don't want your power by accident."

"It's not mine. Not really."

"You know what I mean."

She did.

Outside, wind moved through broken archways and made the temple hum softly, as if the stone itself approved of uncomfortable truths.

They gathered their packs in silence.

At the doorway Ksena paused and looked back at the altar.

"If this is the beginning," she said, "I don't know if I should be hopeful or terrified."

Alcuin adjusted his straps and managed a tight smile. "Both. Probably both."

They stepped out into afternoon light and started down the slope.

Three minutes later Ksena stopped abruptly.

"What now?" Alcuin asked.

She pointed to a faint smoke column in the distance, too thin for natural brushfire.

"People," she said. "Camp or village."

Alcuin followed her gaze and felt his stomach tighten.

"Then we move careful."

"Agreed."

They changed direction toward the smoke, keeping low where terrain allowed.

As they walked, Alcuin felt the strange pressure in his chest settle into something quieter, like embers under ash.

Not gone.

Waiting.

He did not mention it again.

Not yet.

But as sunset painted the plains red and long shadows reached for them from every ridge, he knew with growing certainty that Ksena was not the only one changing.

Whatever the temple had awakened, it had touched both of them.

And this was only the beginning.

By morning, Alcuin could spark flame on command, but only in short bursts before the surge started to fight him.

Kirk logged each attempt with clinical precision while Ksena counted breath cycles and shutdown timing. They treated it like triage, not celebration. If Alcuin's ascension was beginning, then the city would feel it eventually. They needed control before that happened.
