They could see it prowling around outside their camp. It was a cat; it went hunting for food at night; they were rare, Ksena or Alcuin had never seen one in person before, Ksena had only seen them in books, they added onto the fire trying to scare it away, but as the fire grew it crawled in closer, they could clearly see its bright orange fur, scarlet in the fires ruddy glow
They needed to do something else. It was getting closer as it circled them. Ksena called forth her power, but as she did so, the cat’s eyes seem to spark and its attention was centered on Ksena.
it rushed her, it was nimble and quickly darted around Alcuin and launching itself at Ksena, Ksena had just got this power and it was already being tested to defend herself, instead of a tiny fireball to knock the cat back, Ksena flung nearly everything she had at the cat, this close it would be an explosion and being this close Ksena realized she made a mistake as soon as her power left her fingertips, the fireball hit the cat midair and surrounded the cat completely in flames, Ksena collapsed onto one knee from exhaustion as her powers whirled around the cat, she waited for the explosion but it didn't happen, even as Alcuin tried to cover themselves knowing they were to close.
Instead, the cat leap in front of her out of the fire. The cat was still on fire, but it was the same as a full ascension outfit made of living flame. The cat wore the flame as a coat of amour; the explosion dissipated after the cat left it, leaving Ksena and Alcuin alone with the cat that was now preening itself sitting between them


The focus stayed on the fire-cat encounter and resonance with ascendant power. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on the fire-cat encounter and resonance with ascendant power. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on the fire-cat encounter and resonance with ascendant power. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on the fire-cat encounter and resonance with ascendant power. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on the fire-cat encounter and resonance with ascendant power. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.

They kept returning to the fire-cat encounter and what it implied about power resonance, because delay now would only make the next confrontation worse.
