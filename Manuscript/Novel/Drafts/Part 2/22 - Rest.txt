Alone at least, Alcuin turned his hand upwards and tried to summon flame, like he had seen Ksena do. The power pooled slowly at first and a burst of excitement as he let it free for the first time; the burst was enough to see him stumbling back in surprise, hitting his back against the wall, Ksena called out, he quickly snuffed the flame, closing his hand and letting the flames die out, not a moment to soon before Ksena opened the door to his room, Alcuin took a moment to gather his wits as the power still wanted to come out
It’s nothing, I just tripped on my bag
Oh, I thought I felt my sister’s power for a moment and I heard the bang so I came in
To what, protect me?
I was worried, that’s all. Are you okay?
I'm fine, get out, and ask before you come in next time!
Ksena looked at Alcuin hurt by his words, 'sorry, I'm going' slowly she backed out of the room and Alcuin could hear her walk down the hall back to her own room
Alcuin collapsed onto the bed, he hit his pillow cursing himself for being s abrupt with her


The focus stayed on private strain, hidden tests, and repairing trust after harsh words. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on private strain, hidden tests, and repairing trust after harsh words. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on private strain, hidden tests, and repairing trust after harsh words. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on private strain, hidden tests, and repairing trust after harsh words. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on private strain, hidden tests, and repairing trust after harsh words. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.

They kept returning to private strain, apology, and fragile repair between companions, because delay now would only make the next confrontation worse.
