Kalani didn’t think it would be this easy to get rid of her sister, as if she was going to share this power with anyone, it didn’t even take much, a good luck wish, a hand grasp and sending her power flowing through into Ksena and sitting back and watching her sister ritual backfire, one failed attempt, Kalani wasn’t sure why it even worked, she had a theory but she didn’t have anyone else to practice it on, and even if it did, it would might have clued other people onto it
She was sure Ksena would have been just as powerful as her, enough to sense them although Kalani doubted she could do much about it either, she saw an unwilling pawn for them, eventually she would overturn it, but it was difficult to hide anything from them, while they couldn’t mind read, answers had to be 100% truth and she had to do what they command.
Kalani was quite happy Ksena had been exiled, she keep a track of her sister’s progress out in the wilds, her sister is doing exactly what she would have expected, looking for an answer, and when she found it Kalani would be there
The added conflict with these new creatures didn’t even bother her. They had powerful technology but still easy to shoot out of the sky and their invasions have kept the elders busy and given Kalani many chances to go out into the world; they were nothing insects; she was sure she could wipe them out; she had been testing the descriptive uses of her powers, that tribe died so easily, one wave of her hand and the entire tribe was roast, it had been too easy, sure she had been admonished for it, but by the time she was finished talking to the elders they had come around a little, the savages would only get in the way in the next war and they needed to be prepared to fight these humans and burn their ships to the ground.


The focus stayed on the pressure of conquest politics and movement control across settlements. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on the pressure of conquest politics and movement control across settlements. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on the pressure of conquest politics and movement control across settlements. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on the pressure of conquest politics and movement control across settlements. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on the pressure of conquest politics and movement control across settlements. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.

They kept returning to conquest pressure and how movement became controlled, because delay now would only make the next confrontation worse.
