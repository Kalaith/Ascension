She sat before the elder; the elder wore her power heavily around her, her back bent as if struggling to hold the power upright, but Ksena could tell she was powerful, more than her sister or mother, Ksena knew despite her age or because of it she could take on a whole battalion of fighters from her city, but she hadn't why not and why was she outside of the city and such powerful.

'Please tell me why are you not in the city' Ksena asked, her eyes wide with astonishment. 'The city is not a place for me to belong. it's fallen and corrupt'

'I don't understand, how is the city corrupt? It was the final and last standing city of our people after the war'

'I wish that was true' she sighed and looked Ksena directly 'it was among the last of our cities, before the city inhabitants wiped out the other cities after the war'

'They wiped out. Why?'

'We were losing the war, it was going badly and we discovered the ability to ascend, using this power we could drive the enemy into submission, they were many but no longer a threat to us, for some of us that was enough, we had won and been changed into something greater, but for others it was not enough they wanted to wipe out every enemy of the face of the world, to do this the eldest among them forced an Ascension to happen and not only happen but also bind the new ascended to there will'

'You wondered why they kicked you out, with no reason given? It was because you had failed to be controlled. The ritual performed by Alcuin stopped your mind from being taken over by force.'

Ksena looked aghast. This was not what she was. Expecting her people's mind controlled. Enslaved, it couldn't be. Hers was the greatness people in the land.

'I don't understand. If I am not ascended, why would they care about it? I failed the ritual so I can't become ascended.

The elder laughed at that 'It's because you are already party ascended already, you haven't been trained to use your powers, to be shown how to tap into them, but it's happened, your parents are both ascending and your ascended, even if they don't teach you, you may have learned and without the limits on your powers they could not control you.

'Why banish me. why not just kill me'

You are a first, an unknown it's never happened before and unless they test you and your limits they will never know, after your powers manifest they would send someone or a group to hunt you down and kill you, even now they are watching you, and me as I reveal this truth'

But that means that I am now in danger.. 'Yes it does, next time you meet them if your power hasn't grown beyond theirs they will probably kill you,'

What about you aren't you in danger now, I, am but I am. old my time has come and gone; it is not worth their time to attack. Me now they have tried and failed too many times already.

Before they left, the elder gripped Ksena's wrist and forced her to meet her eyes.

"They are already counting your steps," she said. "Do not walk where they expect."

Ksena nodded once. Alcuin memorized the alternate trail the elder sketched into the dust, then wiped it away with his boot.

They departed before sunrise, not because they were ready, but because waiting would only make them easier to find.

From a distance the temple looked like a collapsed hill.

Up close it still held shape.

Half-buried columns rose out of windblown grit. One gate had fallen inward centuries ago, leaving a jagged opening large enough for two people side by side.

Alcuin lit a torch and stepped through first.

"Stay behind me until we know the floor," he said.

Ksena ignored the order for exactly six seconds, distracted by carved stonework under the dust.

"My ancestors built this," she whispered, fingers tracing a worn glyph.

"Your ancestors built a lot of traps," Alcuin muttered. "Watch your feet."

She nearly tripped on a fallen lintel as he said it.

He did not smile. She did not argue.

The interior corridors were long and mostly stripped, as if looters had taken anything portable and time had taken the rest. In one chamber the roof had collapsed, leaving a sloped exit route of packed dirt and broken masonry. Good to know if they needed a fast way out.

At the temple core they stopped.

A circular hall opened above them, ringed with statues.

Top tier: tall ascendant figures in ceremonial flame patterns.

Lower tiers: hunters, workers, families in practical dress that looked unmistakably like Alcuin's people.

All of them faced inward toward a raised central altar.

Alcuin's jaw tightened.

"So this is the story," he said quietly. "Gods above. Everyone else below."

Ksena turned from the altar and looked at him.

"That is not my story."

"Maybe not yours. Maybe theirs."

He stepped back from her hand.

The distance between them felt larger than the chamber.

Ksena moved to him anyway and caught his wrist.

"I do not know what this hall means," she said. "I know what you mean to me. Without you I would have died in the first week after exile."

He did not answer.

"I grew up in gardens," she continued. "You grew up hunting in weather that would have broken me. Out here you are stronger than I am in every way that kept us alive."

Alcuin looked away, then back.

"Then why does this place make me feel like a servant in your temple?"

Ksena stepped closer until he could not avoid her eyes.

"Because this place is old and wrong in ways we do not understand yet," she said. "Help me find the right part."

The anger in his face loosened, not gone, but no longer in command.

He nodded once.

They climbed the altar platform together.

At the top, the stone was smoother, worn by centuries of ritual contact. Two shallow depressions sat opposite each other, hand-width apart.

"Looks like paired activation," Alcuin said.

Ksena swallowed.

"Together?"

"Together."

They placed their hands.

Nothing.

Then the floor pulse came.

Heat surged up through the platform and into their arms. Ksena's fire ignited first, thin lines tracing her shoulders and spine like molten thread. Alcuin tried to pull back, but the current locked both of them in place.

Flame crossed from her skin to his wrists.

He braced for pain.

Instead he felt cold clarity, then pressure, then a sensation like doors opening inside his chest.

The chamber lights flickered to life in concentric rings.

Statues glowed.

Old glyph bands along the walls began to turn, each ring sliding against the next with grinding stone and buried mechanics. For one vertigo-struck moment, Alcuin saw images not with eyes but with nerves: war sky, falling fire, two peoples standing together, then splitting under fear and command.

Ksena cried out and nearly collapsed.

The lock released.

Alcuin caught her before she hit stone.

Their flames guttered and died at the same time.

They sank to the floor, both drenched in sweat, both shaking.

"Are you hurt?" he asked.

Ksena's pupils were wide and unfocused. She blinked hard until she could track his face.

"No burns," she said. "But something changed."

"Same here."

He flexed his fingers. Fire answered faster than before, denser, as if the delay between intent and output had shortened.

Ksena steadied her breathing and looked around the hall with new caution.

"This ritual was never meant for one person," she said. "It was always meant to be shared."

Alcuin followed her gaze across statues no longer silent.

"Then someone rewrote the rules," he said.

They rested only long enough to stand.

Neither trusted the temple to stay quiet.

By dawn they were back in open air, moving away from the ruins with a new burden: whatever the chamber had done, both of them were now tied into power systems they did not yet understand.

The path ahead had just narrowed.

Alcuin felt the power flow through his body as Ksena completed the temple sequence, and for one frozen second he thought he had made a mistake standing so close.

He had whispered the words with her out of habit, half prayer and half mockery, expecting nothing except maybe comfort for her. Instead his skin prickled with heat and his muscles tightened like he had run all day uphill.

Ksena laughed in front of him, flames dancing around her wrists in bright loops as she tested what she could do now. She looked alive in a way he had not seen since before exile.

Alcuin forced himself to smile back.

"You did it," he said.

"Not all the way," Ksena replied, turning one palm and watching a thread of fire bloom between her fingers. "But it's different now. I can feel it listening."

Listening.

That word unsettled him.

He stepped away from the center platform and leaned against a cracked pillar until the dizziness passed. The temple air smelled like dust, old stone, and something metallic he could not name.

"Are you okay?" Ksena asked, noticing him at last.

"Fine," he lied.

She narrowed her eyes. "You look pale."

"I've looked like this my whole life."

"Alcuin."

He sighed and gave in by half. "Something happened when we spoke the words. I felt... pressure. Not pain. Just pressure."

Ksena's expression shifted from joy to concern.

"Like the ritual?"

"No. Different. Yours looked like drowning in light. This felt like standing near a forge too long."

She walked closer and held out her hand. "Let me feel your pulse."

"You're not a healer."

"Neither are you. Hand."

He gave it to her.

Her fingers were warm, warmer than they should have been. She counted silently, then frowned.

"It's fast."

"Could be fear."

"Are you afraid?"

"Yes," he said, surprising both of them with the honesty.

Ksena did not let go immediately.

"Me too," she said quietly.

They stood like that in the dead temple, two exiles in a room built by people who had expected history to remember them.

When she released his hand, Alcuin flexed his fingers and saw, just for an instant, a faint orange spark at his knuckles.

He jerked his hand back.

"Did you see that?"

"See what?"

"Nothing."

He hated how quickly he said it.

Ksena crossed her arms. "We don't hide things from each other anymore."

"I know."

"Then?"

He exhaled. "I thought I saw a spark. Might have been reflection from your flames."

Ksena glanced at his hand, then at the scorched marks in the stone around the altar.

"The projection said power transfer was possible," she said. "Maybe that wasn't just history."

"I don't want your power by accident."

"It's not mine. Not really."

"You know what I mean."

She did.

Outside, wind moved through broken archways and made the temple hum softly, as if the stone itself approved of uncomfortable truths.

They gathered their packs in silence.

At the doorway Ksena paused and looked back at the altar.

"If this is the beginning," she said, "I don't know if I should be hopeful or terrified."

Alcuin adjusted his straps and managed a tight smile. "Both. Probably both."

They stepped out into afternoon light and started down the slope.

Three minutes later Ksena stopped abruptly.

"What now?" Alcuin asked.

She pointed to a faint smoke column in the distance, too thin for natural brushfire.

"People," she said. "Camp or village."

Alcuin followed her gaze and felt his stomach tighten.

"Then we move careful."

"Agreed."

They changed direction toward the smoke, keeping low where terrain allowed.

As they walked, Alcuin felt the strange pressure in his chest settle into something quieter, like embers under ash.

Not gone.

Waiting.

He did not mention it again.

Not yet.

But as sunset painted the plains red and long shadows reached for them from every ridge, he knew with growing certainty that Ksena was not the only one changing.

Whatever the temple had awakened, it had touched both of them.

And this was only the beginning.

By morning, Alcuin could spark flame on command, but only in short bursts before the surge started to fight him.

Kirk logged each attempt with clinical precision while Ksena counted breath cycles and shutdown timing. They treated it like triage, not celebration. If Alcuin's ascension was beginning, then the city would feel it eventually. They needed control before that happened.
