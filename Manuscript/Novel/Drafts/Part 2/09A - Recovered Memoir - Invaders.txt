Ksena found the pages in a cracked records chest behind a collapsed wall, wrapped in waxed cloth that had gone hard with age.

Most archive bundles held inventories, ration tallies, and council orders. This one held a handwritten account in a private voice, copied at least twice by different hands, with the final page stamped as restricted under an old seal no current office still used.

She read it once in silence, then handed it to Alcuin.

"If this is genuine," she said, "then half of what we were taught began as damage control."

Alcuin read the first page, then looked up.

"Or full control," he said.

Ksena rolled the pages flat, lit a lantern, and copied the text into her field book exactly as written.

Recovered memoir transcript:

The war began without warning.

One day our world was peaceful. The next, there was fire in the streets, shattered towers, and bodies where markets had stood. We had weapons, but they did almost nothing. Our scientists worked day and night searching for an answer. They failed, and then the answer came from somewhere older than science.

For generations we had kept our temples, our rituals, and our prayers, even when many treated them as tradition instead of truth. When invasion came, people returned to them in desperation. Temple leaders were called heroes by some and fanatics by others, but they traveled from city to city gathering crowds to pray.

I was there when the first true ascended appeared.

They had prayed at nearly every temple in the country. At the final temple, while thousands knelt and called out to the divine, fire formed around one man and did not consume him. At first the light was blinding. When my vision cleared, he was floating above the stones, wrapped in flame, changed in body and presence.

He became the first of what people called our holy army.

Where artillery failed, he could halt an entire assault with a single motion. Enemy soldiers burst into fire before they reached our lines. Others ascended after him. Soon we were not retreating. We were winning.

If the story had ended there, it would have been a miracle worth singing for a thousand years. It did not end there.

Driven into a corner, the invaders escalated. They attacked by land and sky with a fury that felt desperate, as if defeat on our world would destroy them. Our ascended forces held, but at terrible cost. By the end, almost everything outside the capital lay in ruins. Cities, towns, and fields were broken. Millions were dead.

In the final campaign our forces cornered the enemy commander on our world and killed him. We called it victory because we had no other word left.

Then the ascended left us.

Our people were shattered, and the ones we had trusted most were gone. With the old infrastructure destroyed and famine spreading, many communities fell back to hunter life just to survive. Later we learned the ascended had built a new city and sealed themselves inside it. No one ever gave us an answer for why.

So we remained in a ruined world, abandoned by the very army that had saved us.

I write this account so at least part of the truth survives. If memory dies, then their version becomes the only version. I fear for our people. With our heart removed, what future can we still claim?

End transcript.

Alcuin sat with the copied pages across his knees for a long time.

"If this is true," he said quietly, "your city did not inherit leadership. It inherited a retreat."

Ksena tied the transcript into her field wraps.

"Then we stop arguing over stories," she said. "From now on, we collect proof."

They packed before dawn and moved north with one more document that someone had tried very hard to bury.
