Ksena found the pages in a cracked records chest behind a collapsed wall, wrapped in waxed cloth that had gone hard with age.

Most archive bundles held inventories, ration tallies, and council orders. This one held a handwritten account in a private voice, copied at least twice by different hands, with the final page stamped as restricted under an old seal no current office still used.

She read the first section and froze.

Alcuin watched her face.

"Bad?"

"Useful," she said. "And dangerous."

They moved camp under cover before sunset, set one lantern low, and spread the pages between them.

Ksena read aloud in short excerpts, then stopped each time to test claims against known records.

Excerpt one:

"The war began without warning... our weapons failed... temple rites were reopened in desperation."

Alcuin tapped a margin note.

"Matches the burned district casualty dates from the north archive."

Excerpt two:

"At the final temple, one man rose in fire and did not burn. Others followed."

Ksena checked the copying hand.

"Different scribe from page one. This section was added later, but still old."

Excerpt three:

"We won, and then the ascended left us. They built a sealed city and gave no answer for why."

Silence settled.

Alcuin looked up.

"If true, your city did not inherit leadership. It inherited retreat and called it destiny."

"If true," Ksena said. "So we prove it."

She copied only verifiable lines into her field book and marked every uncertain claim with source doubts, date gaps, and cross-reference targets.

By first light they had a work list instead of a myth list.

"First," Ksena said, "we validate the temple locations named in the memoir. That's our starting point."

Alcuin nodded. "Then match casualty windows to independent civic ledgers. If the dates align, we have something."

"Right," she agreed. "Next, identify when the sealed-city narrative replaced shared-history records. That'll show us the cover-up timeline."

"And finally," Alcuin added, "track who classified the original bundle as restricted. Names mean motives."

Ksena tied the pages back into waxed cloth.

"No speeches," she said. "No belief tests. Only proof."

They packed before dawn and moved north with one more document that someone had tried very hard to bury.
