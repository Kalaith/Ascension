By the time Estele's rejoin window closed, Alcuin knew she had either been delayed or forced off-route.

He did not say that out loud yet.

Alcuin felt the watcher before he found the signs.

The weight between his shoulder blades never left. Birds rose too early from brush. Small stones shifted where no wind moved. Whoever tracked them was disciplined.

Ksena noticed his silence by noon.

"Are you all right?" she asked as they crossed dry flats.

"Headache," he said.

Not a complete lie.

He did not tell her yet. If he was wrong, fear would cost them focus. If he was right, he needed one clean read first.

By late afternoon he found it: a deliberate notch on deadwood at knee height, fresh cut, hunter code for "I see you."

He said nothing and kept moving.

At sunset, smoke rose on the horizon.

Alcuin's pace shifted from walk to run. Ksena followed, lungs burning.

They reached the village at failing light.

Nothing remained worth calling a village.

Timber frames collapsed into black ribs. The central well had caved. Bones lay where people had fallen. Heat pattern said this had happened fast and from above.

Ksena bent over, fighting breath.

"Survivors?"

Alcuin scanned once and shook his head.

"At least a week old."

He knelt and whispered an old hunter prayer over ash. Ksena stood beside him and added her own uncertain words.

When they rose, both looked older.

"We move," Alcuin said. "If someone finds us here, they could blame you before asking questions."

Above them, hidden on a ridge, Maera watched with fists clenched.

She had followed Alcuin from his village through rain, heat, and two wrong trail branches. She had told herself she would drag him home if she had to. Now she watched him stand beside the exiled ascendant at a burn site and felt anger twist with something more complicated.

If city fire had done this, Alcuin was in worse danger than he understood.

That night she left signs only he would read: route scratches, one safe camp mark near water.

Alcuin saw both.

They camped by a narrow river bend with defensive ground and limited approach lanes.

When fire took, Alcuin grabbed hunting gear.

"Stay by the coals," he told Ksena. "Do not wander."

She studied him too long, then nodded.

After he left, she filled a pot, set it to boil, and sat alone with river hiss and smoke memory.

In thorn shade beyond camp, Alcuin found Maera waiting.

"Come out," he said.

She stepped into weak hand-flame, jaw hard.

"You look terrible," she said.

"So do you."

No greeting. No embrace. Just years of familiarity turned sharp.

She pointed back toward camp.

"That girl will get you killed."

"If I leave her, she dies faster," Alcuin said.

Maera opened her mouth, saw his expression, and changed direction.

"Village east of here burned. Too hot for raiders. You needed warning before you walked blind."

He nodded once.

"Thank you."

She gave a bitter laugh.

"Don't thank me yet. I still might drag you home by force."

"I don't have a home to drag back to," he said.

She looked away first.

When they separated, no promises were made.

Alcuin returned with two river fowl and one more half-truth.

"Bad luck on trail," he told Ksena.

She accepted it for now.

They ate in near silence while three loyalties tracked the same path through darkness.

Near midnight something prowled at camp edge.

At first Ksena thought wolf. Then coals caught orange fur and long tail.

A cat.

Rare enough she had only seen drawings in city records.

It circled close to firelight, unafraid.

"Do not feed it," Alcuin whispered.

Ksena called a spark to her fingertips to warn it off.

The cat's eyes flared bright.

Then it lunged.

Alcuin moved to intercept, but Ksena fired first on instinct, sending far too much flame at close range.

Fire swallowed the animal midair.

She dropped to one knee, expecting explosion.

It never came.

The cat landed in front of her wrapped in living flame, not burning, wearing the fire like a second hide.

It sat down and began cleaning one paw as if nothing had happened.

Alcuin stared.

"That should have killed it."

Ksena held one hand low and open.

The cat stepped forward and touched her fingers with its nose.

Heat pulsed through her wrist.

Recognition, not injury.

The animal circled once and settled near the coals as if choosing them.

By dawn it still followed.

Ksena laughed once under her breath.

"I think we adopted a fire spirit."

"I think it found a heat source," Alcuin said, watching the cat stretch. "It's not a pet. It's feeding on the waste energy. We aren't owners; we're batteries."

They named it Katesh before noon.

The next shelter they found was an abandoned relay house, stone intact, doors swollen with age but usable.

That night, while Ksena slept with Katesh curled at her feet, Alcuin stood alone in side room and tried to summon flame deliberately.

A weak spark became a sudden burst that slammed him backward into wall.

Ksena burst through the door.

"What happened?"

"I tripped," he said too fast.

She stared at scorch mark behind him.

"Alcuin."

He looked away.

"I don't know how to control it yet."

Hurt flashed across her face before she contained it.

"Then tell me next time before it becomes a problem."

He snapped back from shame more than anger.

"Get out."

She left without another word.

Five minutes later he wanted to break his own jaw.

Later she returned with a ration tin and held it out silently.

He took one bite, handed it back.

"Half each," he said.

Not elegant.

Real.

They ate in the hallway and reviewed route options by lantern until fatigue blurred the symbols.

Before sleep, Alcuin admitted he had almost lost control.

Ksena nodded once.

"Then we train it. Together."

He agreed.

Outside, rain started and stopped in uneven bursts while Katesh watched the dark with unblinking ember eyes.

If ascension energy was moving into creatures now, the map had already changed.

None of them understood how much.


By dawn, Estele still had not reached the relay house marker.
They adjusted route under assumption of contact pressure and kept moving north.

On the second evening without Estele, they reached the relay house marker and found no sign of her, only a fresh scratch code on the lower post:

DELAYED. TRACE HOT. CONTINUE NORTH.

Ksena ran her fingers over the mark.

"Her hand?"

"Yes," Alcuin said. "Fast cut, left angle. She was moving under pressure."

They kept moving.

At midnight, Katesh stiffened and stared toward a ridge where no sound carried. Alcuin signaled stop, then dropped flat and motioned Ksena lower.

Two silhouettes crossed skyline in staggered spacing, each pausing exactly where line-of-sight opened toward their previous camp route.

"Pattern trackers," Alcuin whispered. "Not random patrol."

Ksena felt anger rise and forced it down into breath count.

"Can we shake them?"

"Not cleanly. We can feed them wrong timing."

He laid out a short deception plan in the dark:

- leave decoy ash circle in visible hollow,
- cross the stream twice to break scent trail,
- move one extra hour past fatigue limit before first rest,
- no repeated shelter profile.

They executed all four.

At dawn they reached a basalt shelf where wind erased prints within minutes. Ksena's legs trembled from lack of sleep, but her voice stayed steady when Alcuin asked for the next route call.

"North-east gully," she said. "Less cover, better runoff line if we need water."

He nodded once.

"Good read."

By afternoon they found another burned hamlet, smaller than the first, with fewer structures and the same heat signatures on stone.

No bodies this time.

Only abandoned tools and one child's chalk drawing half-preserved on a wall.

Ksena stood in front of it for a long time.

"Either they fled in time," she said, "or someone moved them before strike."

Alcuin crouched by the lane and lifted a stamped ration token.

"Evacuation marker from two districts east," he said. "Could be Estele's warning route."

Hope, small and dangerous, crossed Ksena's face and was gone.

"Then she got some of them out."

"Maybe," Alcuin said. "Write it as suspected, not known."

She did.

By dusk, they had one certainty left that still held under exhaustion:

If they let fear define movement, the trackers won.

If they let grief define movement, the killers won.

So they chose method again.

And kept walking.
