'Sis-' the words died in her mouth, that was defiantly her sister flying above the village they headed towards, something beckoned her to be quiet as she watched her sister, maybe they were out looking for her, to finally bring her home, but it didn't seem to be the case, in one horrifying moment Ksena watched her sister raise her hand, summoning a large amount of fire and with a casual flick of her wrist sending it down on the unsuspecting village below, Ksena could hear the screams as her sisters power reached the ground in the center of the village and exploded, burning everything in the area, Alcuin screamed and rushed towards the village, but Ksena was too shocked to move, she thought this was the humans doing, not her own flesh and blood, how could her sister do that to the village, what had they done to deserve it, she wanted to reach out to her sister but she couldn't lift her hand or take a step, and her sister satisfied with her work, sped off back to home.
Ksena couldn't look at him. The village was destroyed, bodies laid still, charred and smoldering, the air smelt of burnt flesh and it was her sisters doing, the other village was that her sisters doing as well.


The focus stayed on witnessing Kalani's attack and accepting that family is now a threat. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on witnessing Kalani's attack and accepting that family is now a threat. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on witnessing Kalani's attack and accepting that family is now a threat. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on witnessing Kalani's attack and accepting that family is now a threat. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on witnessing Kalani's attack and accepting that family is now a threat. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.
