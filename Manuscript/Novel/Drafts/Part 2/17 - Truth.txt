'Sis-' the words died in her mouth, that was defiantly her sister flying above the village they headed towards, something beckoned her to be quiet as she watched her sister, maybe they we're out looking for her, to finally bring her home, but it didn't seem to be the case, in one horrifying moment Ksena watched her sister raise her hand, summoning a large amount of fire and with a casual flick of her wrist sending it down on the unsuspecting village below, Ksena could hear the screams as her sisters power reached the ground in the center of the village and exploded, burning everything in the area, Alcuin screamed and rushed towards the village, but Ksena was too shocked to move, she thought this was the humans doing, not her own flesh and blood, how could her sister do that to the village, what had they done to deserve it, she wanted to reach out to her sister but she couldn't lift her hand or take a step, and her sister satisfied with her work, sped off back to home.
Ksena couldn't look at him. The village was destroyed, bodies laid still, charred and smoldering, the air smelt of burnt flesh and it was her sisters doing, the other village was that her sisters doing as we'll.

That night they camped without a fire.

Alcuin sat awake with his back to a stone outcrop while Ksena stared into darkness where the village used to stand. Neither of them said Kalani's name again. They did not need to. By sunrise, grief had hardened into direction. If the city had done this through Kalani, then every next step had to be about evidence, allies, and timing. Shock could not be the strategy.
