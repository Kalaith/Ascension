The second industrial city sat in a basin of black stone and white mineral runoff, half-hidden by old cooling towers that no longer cooled anything.

Locals called it Foundry Reach.

Old records called it Interlock Basin.

Ksena called it proof the world had once been more coordinated than any current doctrine allowed.

They arrived under rain and entered through maintenance ward gate after Estele exchanged route code with two basin wardens in patched pressure jackets.

"You get one day in technical quarter," the lead warden said. "No map copying without witness. No open power output in enclosed halls."

"Understood," Ksena said.

Inside, Foundry Reach looked less collapsed than Iron District and more exhausted.

Systems still functioned.

Barely.

Conveyor lanes moved at half cadence.

Hydraulic lifts needed hand-assist on every third cycle.

Water filtration stacks ran on hybrid assemblies combining antique ceramic cores and new scrap shells.

A civic engineer named Maerin took them through district operations with blunt honesty.

"We maintain six critical loops," she said. "If two fail simultaneously, we choose what goes dark."

"How often does that happen?" Alcuin asked.

"This year? Twice."

Maerin brought them first to Control Gallery, a curved room lined with pressure dials and analog boards.

Half the dials had cracked glass.

Three were replaced by hand-painted markers because proper units were unavailable.

"Command promised digital retrofit fifteen years ago," Maerin said. "Sent inspectors, not parts."

Ksena read board labels and saw policy architecture in plain sight:

- Priority: Central district food storage.
- Priority: Inner command housing climate control.
- Priority: Ritual corridor redundancy.

Outer clinics and worker housing sat lower in allocation rank than ceremonial cooling lines.

"These allocations are current?" she asked.

"Updated quarterly," Maerin said. "By people who call us essential and then deprioritize our failures."

At Pump Court, they watched a night-shift team rotate under manual flood protocol because auto-gates had drifted out of calibration.

The supervisor, a broad-shouldered woman named Halen, explained while tightening a valve spindle by hand.

"Auto-sensors fail dirty," Halen said. "Manual teams fail tired."

"Which fails less?" Ksena asked.

"Depends who gets to sleep."

In Heat Hall, older workers taught younger ones to diagnose boiler behavior by listening to resonance with metal rods held against pipes.

"Training used to be formal," one elder said. "Now it's apprenticeship and memory because certification classes require command permission and travel tokens we don't receive."

By midday, Ksena's notes had shifted from political to operational:

- failure modes,
- staffing thresholds,
- dependency chokepoints,
- timeline to critical collapse if current trend continued.

At food hall, Maerin handed Ksena ration tea and pointed toward wall chart tracking infrastructure incidents.

Red marks outnumbered green in every sector.

"People say decay is natural after war," Maerin said. "Decay is natural. Neglect is policy."

That line went straight into Ksena's field doctrine.

Afternoon brought live crisis.

Loop Four pressure dropped without warning. Alarm chimes echoed through lower district. Teams sprinted to gate controls while wardens rerouted civilians away from steam corridor.

Maerin looked at Ksena.

"You wanted to learn. Learn now."

Ksena, Alcuin, and Estele joined emergency chain under local command.

No heroics.

No speeches.

Tasks.

Ksena held relay timing calls while Halen and two apprentices forced manual bypass open with pipe bar leverage. Alcuin moved valve crates and kept lane clear. Estele coordinated runner traffic between gallery and pump court.

For twenty-three minutes they ran blind on partial data and shouted cadence over metal roar.

At minute twenty-four, pressure stabilized.

At minute twenty-five, one clinic lane lost heat service anyway.

No deaths.

One elderly patient in respiratory distress.

Three workers with steam burns.

Maerin leaned against wall after shutdown and laughed once from pure exhaustion.

"Congratulations," she said to Ksena. "You just participated in what command calls minor service interruption."

Ksena looked at burned gloves, blood on one apprentice's sleeve, and the line of families waiting for restored water access.

"Minor to who?" she said.

No one answered because everyone knew.

That evening district council convened in machine canteen instead of formal chamber because no one had time for theater.

Maerin asked Ksena and Alcuin to stay as observers. Five agenda items, all survival:

1. Whether to shut one fabrication line to preserve filtration loop.
2. How to ration replacement seals.
3. How to staff night watches without burning out two key mechanics.
4. Whether to request command assistance and risk political capture of local authority.
5. How to preserve training continuity if senior technicians were conscripted.

The debate was fierce and practical.

No one invoked destiny.

No one invoked bloodline.

Only constraints.

Only consequences.

After council, Ksena stood with Maerin on rain-slick balcony above cooling stacks.

"You expected ruins," Maerin said.

"I expected decay," Ksena answered. "I didn't expect this much competence under deprivation."

"Write that down too," Maerin said. "People forget we are not failing because we are incapable. We are failing because capability has been turned into licensed property."

Before departure, Maerin gave Ksena two sealed packets.

Packet one: incident logs, allocation orders, and six-year maintenance request denials.

Packet two: local training modules rewritten for low-resource deployment.

"If you're serious about reform," Maerin said, "start with open technical education and allocation transparency. Without those, you replace one ruling class with another."

Ksena nodded.

"Understood."

At dawn they left Foundry Reach under low cloud and crossed ridge where both industrial basins could be seen in the same line of sight.

Smoke from one.

Steam from the other.

Neither stable.

Both alive because people kept choosing to repair what policy had abandoned.

On the march north, Alcuin broke silence first.

"We came looking for ancient truth," he said. "Found machine politics instead."

Ksena adjusted the strap on packet satchel.

"Machine politics decides who eats, who freezes, who can travel, and who can resist," she said. "That's not separate from truth. That's truth with fewer rituals."

Estele glanced back.

"Then what now?"

Ksena answered without hesitation.

"Now we fold industrial evidence into resistance planning."

She counted on fingers as she walked:

- protect pump and rail nodes,
- secure manuals and training pathways,
- decentralize repair authority,
- publish allocation orders,
- tie military decisions to infrastructure impact.

Alcuin nodded slowly.

"You sound like governance already."

"I sound like someone who just watched a district nearly collapse because one valve failed and three requests were denied," she said.

By sunset they reached rendezvous marker where Kirk's scout beacon blinked weak green from a rock shelf.

Human contact was near.

Enemy movement was increasing.

And Ksena now carried industrial evidence that transformed the conflict from family rebellion into systems war.

The scope of her war had expanded.

Not away from personal stakes.

Through them.

Because every promise she might make later about freedom would be measured against whether people in places like Foundry Reach could keep water moving without asking permission from the next person who claimed to be savior.

They made one final stop before rendezvous: Training Shed Nine, a long building with roof patches in six different metals and a painted sign that read APPRENTICES FIRST.

Inside, fifteen trainees practiced diagnostics under two exhausted instructors.

No uniforms.

No rank bands.

Only tools, diagrams, and repetition.

An instructor named Vel laid a stripped regulator assembly on the table and pointed at Ksena.

"You've been taking notes all week," Vel said. "Answer this. If flow drops and pressure rises at once, what's your first question?"

Ksena looked at the assembly, then at the line graph chalked behind it.

"Where is the false reading?"

Vel nodded once.

"Good. Never trust first instrument in a neglected system."

He turned to the apprentices.

"That applies to politics too."

Laughter rippled, then work resumed.

Before they left, Vel handed Ksena a small metal tag stamped with an old training guild emblem.

"Carry this when you speak about reform," he said. "Reminds people you stood in workrooms, not just council chambers."

Ksena accepted it.

"I won't make promises I can't defend," she said.

"Don't make promises," Vel replied. "Make access." 

Outside, rain eased to mist.

Ksena tucked the tag beside Jina's packet and Maerin's logs.

Personal stakes had started this path.

Industrial reality had reshaped it.

Now when she imagined victory, it no longer looked like one chamber, one duel, one declaration.

It looked like manuals reopened, apprentices certified without bloodline filters, and districts like Foundry Reach deciding maintenance schedules without waiting for ceremonial permission.

That vision was less dramatic.

It was also the only version that could survive.
