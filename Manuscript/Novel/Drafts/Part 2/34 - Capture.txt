Kirk woke to smoke, pain, and alarm tone.

The escape pod had carved a trench into red stone before stopping nose-down in scrub. Half the guidance panel was dead. Long-range comms were gone. So was any chance of quick extraction.

He had maybe twenty minutes before daylight made him obvious.

Then he saw movement below the ridge.

Two locals. One female, one male. Both armed. Both moving like fighters.

He raised his hands and called through external speaker in slow trade-standard.

"Do not fire. I am not hostile."

The answer was a flame strike that scorched the pod hull.

"All right," Kirk muttered. "Negotiation later."

The male charged first. Kirk fired a sedative dart to center mass, then a second when momentum kept him coming. The female drew flame around her hands. He hit her shoulder with one dart and leg with another before she could release.

Both went down hard.

He waited thirty seconds, checked reflexes, and moved.

Dragging two unconscious aliens into shade by himself took longer than he wanted. The male was heavier than he looked. The female was lighter but had burn-hot skin for several minutes after sedation, like her nervous system was still trying to ignite.

Kirk bound wrists and ankles with restraint cord, then set camp twenty paces away where he could watch both.

He kept his sidearm in reach.

The male woke first, rolled, and tested bindings with practiced force.

Kirk switched on his field translator.

"Hello," he said.

The male froze, then stared at him with open hostility and careful curiosity.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Kirk Hale. Human expeditionary scout." Kirk nodded toward the female. "I removed her gag only if we can talk without fire."

"Release us," the male said. "You attacked us."

"You attacked me first."

The male looked toward his companion and then back.

"She is not the one who destroyed your ship," he said. "That was an ascended."

Kirk held his expression neutral, though the distinction landed.

"You are saying same species, different actor."

"Yes."

Kirk considered for a second, then removed the female's mouth binding and stepped back.

She inhaled once, hard, and fixed him with a glare sharp enough to cut.

"Who did you come to help?" she asked. "A village burned near here. Was that your doing?"

"No," Kirk said. "I hit only you two with sedative darts. Nothing else."

"Then who burned it?"

"A woman who looked like you," he said. "Same phenotype. More power output. She destroyed my shuttle in under six seconds."

The female flinched.

"My sister," she said under her breath.

Silence followed.

Kirk broke it with mission context.

"We intercepted an old distress beacon from this world. Message requested assistance against an external threat. Transit took six years. We arrived to fragmented societies, no unified command, and active hostilities we do not yet understand."

The male frowned. "Six years?"

"One-way," Kirk said. "No live link home."

The female sat straighter despite restraints.

"The war in our records ended centuries ago," she said. "If your beacon is from that era, then someone or something kept it transmitting."

Kirk nodded. "Exactly why I need information before I decide who is attacking whom."

The male gave him a long measuring look.

"My name is Alcuin," he said. "This is Ksena. We were exiled from different factions. We are not your enemy unless you make us one."

Kirk almost smiled.

"That is the best first-contact sentence I have heard all month."

Ksena's mouth twitched despite herself.

"Then untie us and prove you mean it."

Kirk did not do it immediately.

He asked five more questions first: known safe routes, current faction boundaries, nearest settlements, observed aerial threats, and whether either had direct control over large armed groups.

Answers were messy but consistent.

No obvious deception markers.

He cut their restraints.

Alcuin rubbed his wrists and did not rush him. Ksena stood slowly, eyes still wary.

"You tranquilized us hard," she said.

"You tried to incinerate me," Kirk replied.

"Fair."

By full daylight they had shifted from captor and prisoners to three exhausted survivors with overlapping problems.

Kirk shared rations and a topographic overlay. Ksena marked ritual sites. Alcuin marked hunter paths and danger zones. The map between them became the first real agreement.

Before they moved, Kirk tapped a damaged comm unit and looked toward the horizon where smoke from his shuttle still drifted.

"My team will assume I am dead unless I reach relay range," he said. "Until then, we are operating off trust and necessity."

Alcuin checked his knife edge and nodded.

"Then walk with us. We have both."
