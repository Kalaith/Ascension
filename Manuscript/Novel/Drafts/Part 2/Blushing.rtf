\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Kirk knew something was off, both Ksena and Alcuin where doing their best to avoid eye contact with him, and everything they made eye contact they would both be blushing, Kirk smirked to himself, so those two have finally settled their differences, Kirk was a little jealous, bagging an alien would have defiantly been something he could have bragged about, how many other humans have done the same thing, but Kirk doubted he ever stood a chance, while Ksena was attractive in an alien sense and there was defiantly interest, it was obvious from the start that these two where going to be a couple, although Kirk wondered a little about the anatomy of it all, before blushing himself, maybe if Ksena sister either stopped being a homicidal maniac, but Kirk doubt that, regardless if they are controlled or not, she was bad news for anyone, Kirk looked over again at Ksena who was still doing her best to act natural, did she realize what her sister was, who she was, Kirk should his head, he doubt it, they were family for now he would take extra special care around Ksena\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s sister, always have a backup plan so Ksena doesn\u8217\'92t get them all killed one day.}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Kirk actually felt more like an older brother for these two aliens, they knew less about the world than he did and they had lived their whole lives here, it\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s like they lived in a cult, I guess that was defiantly true in Ksena\u8217\'92s case; he looked up at her again and she just dropped her bottle trying to cover her blushing face.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Oh well, thought Kirk. Hopefully, these two don't drown me in, honey. I don't think I could take them being all lovey-dovey all the time.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hey Alcuin, Ksena I know you two are having fun, but we want to be out of here before the afternoon we will never reach the city, Kirk laughed while Alcuin spluttered and Ksena tried to hide her face which couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t look any redder}}
