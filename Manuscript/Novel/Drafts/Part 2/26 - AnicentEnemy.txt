It should be here. It had to be.

Ksena stood on a wind-scoured rise and looked down at the broken city from her ritual images. Only ruins remained: cracked streets swallowed by grass, tilted walls, and hollow towers with birds nesting where commanders once stood.

"This is the enemy city?" Alcuin asked.

"From the image, yes."

"Then either your image was old or your elders we're afraid of ghosts."

Ksena did not answer.

She climbed down into the ruins anyway, stepping over collapsed stone and roots thick as ropes. The place carried a heavy silence, not empty, but waiting.

She stopped in what had once been a central square. The shape was still visible beneath debris.

"I saw this," she whispered. "In the ritual. There we're fire lines here. Ascendants and... them."

"Who are 'them' exactly?" Alcuin asked.

"I don't know. That's the problem."

They searched by method.

First pass: structural survey for intact buildings.

Second pass: artifacts and inscriptions.

Third pass: route viability and threat checks.

Most structures we're too damaged to enter safely. One archive-like hall retained half a roof and interior wall panels etched with symbols unlike city script.

Alcuin ran his hand over the panel.

"You read this?"

"No," Ksena said. "Not fully. Some symbols match old ascendant roots. Others don't."

"Could be a different species language."

"Or mixed recording after occupation."

In the lower district they found evidence the ruins had not been untouched: recent footprints, small fire remains, and two scavenger marks etched on a doorway.

"We are not alone," Alcuin said.

"Scavengers?"

"Maybe. Maybe watchers."

They reduced voice volume and continued.

In a buried chamber beneath the western wall, Ksena found a cylindrical device half embedded in dust. She brushed off the top and triggered a faint blue pulse.

"Still powered," she said.

Alcuin stepped back. "Do not explode us."

"Very helpful."

She turned the cylinder and a narrow projection line appeared in the air, mapping an orbital approach vector and defense arcs.

Both of them stared.

"That's not local," Alcuin said.

"No. That's sky war mapping."

The projection stuttered, then switched to warning glyphs and went dark.

Ksena sat back on her heels, heart racing.

"The city wasn't just fighting ground forces," she said. "It was part of a planetary defense system."

"Against the foreign species from your images."

"Most likely."

"Then why does your city teach this as if the threat is current and immediate?"

"Maybe because fear keeps control stable."

The answer tasted bitter.

Near sunset they heard stones shift somewhere above and both moved to cover positions instinctively.

A young scavenger boy appeared at the chamber entrance with a sling in hand and panic in his eyes. He froze when he saw them.

"Don't move," Alcuin said.

"I'm not stealing from you," the boy blurted.

"Then why follow us?" Ksena asked.

"Because outsiders usually bring tools and then leave useful scrap," he said, honest in the way frightened people are.

Ksena exchanged a look with Alcuin.

"Any adults nearby?" she asked.

"Camp three ridges east."

"Any ascendants?"

He shook his head hard. "No flames."

"Any recent fights in ruins?"

"Sometimes riders come and chase us out," he said. "South uniforms mostly."

That mattered.

"Thank you," Ksena said.

She tossed him a wrapped ration strip from her pack. He caught it and vanished before she could ask more.

"South uniforms," Alcuin repeated. "Your city still sends teams here."

"Then this place still matters to them."

They camped in a defensible alcove and took turns watching approaches.

During her watch, Ksena looked out over the moonlit ruins and tried to reconcile what she had been told with what she had now seen.

The enemy city was real.

The war was real.

The collapse was ancient.

The current threat level was uncertain.

Yet patrol interest remained active.

Someone still cared what stayed buried here.

At dawn they returned to the chamber and removed the cylindrical projector using leverage poles and cloth wraps to protect it. It was heavy but portable with effort.

"If we bring this to a scholar city," Alcuin said, "we might get translation and chronology."

"If we keep it," Ksena replied, "we might paint a target on ourselves."

"Already painted, I think."

Fair.

Before leaving, Ksena stood in the center square one last time.

The grass moved in the wind where once armies had stood.

"I thought finding this place would answer everything," she said.

"What did it answer?"

"That the story is bigger than either city admits."

Alcuin adjusted the carry straps on the projector.

"Good. Bigger stories have more exits."

She gave him a tired smile.

They left the enemy city by the north road, carrying evidence, uncertainty, and a map marked with two new danger zones.

Behind them, the ruins settled back into silence.

Ahead, the road led toward people who might translate what they had found.

And somewhere beyond that, toward the council that had exiled her.

Ksena no longer expected a simple confrontation.

To fight a lie this old, she would need proof, allies, and time.

The ancient enemy city had given her the first of those.

Now she had to earn the rest.

They left the ruin by the north road while dawn was still gray. Alcuin carried the projector wrapped in oilcloth and rope, and Ksena kept her hand on it whenever the trail narrowed, as if letting go might erase what they had found. Behind them, the enemy city sank back into silence.

"No more guesses," Ksena said.

"No more guesses," Alcuin agreed.

The next stop would not be about faith or memory. It would be about proof.
