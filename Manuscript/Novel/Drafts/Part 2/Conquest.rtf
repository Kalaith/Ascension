\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Kalani didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t think it would be this easy to get rid of her sister, as if she was going to share this power with anyone, it didn\u8217\'92t even take much, a good luck wish, a hand grasp and sending her power flowing through into Ksena and sitting back and watching her sister ritual backfire, one failed attempt, Kalani wasn\u8217\'92t sure why it even worked, she had a theory but she didn\u8217\'92t have anyone else to practice it on, and even if it did, it would might have clued other people onto it}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 She was sure Ksena would have been just as powerful as her, enough to sense them although Kalani doubted she could do much about it either, she saw an unwilling pawn for them, eventually she would overturn it, but it was difficult to hide anything from them, while they couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t mind read, answers had to be 100% truth and she had to do what they command.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Kalani was quite happy Ksena had been exiled, she keep a track of her sister\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s progress out in the wilds, her sister is doing exactly what she would have expected, looking for an answer, and when she found it Kalani would be there}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The added conflict with these new creatures didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t even bother her. They had powerful technology but still easy to shoot out of the sky and their invasions have kept the elders busy and given Kalani many chances to go out into the world; they were nothing insects; she was sure she could wipe them out; she had been testing the descriptive uses of her powers, that tribe died so easily, one wave of her hand and the entire tribe was roast, it had been too easy, sure she had been admonished for it, but by the time she was finished talking to the elders they had come around a little, the savages would only get in the way in the next war and they needed to be prepared to fight these humans and burn their ships to the ground.}}
