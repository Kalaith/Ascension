Alcuin felt the watcher long before he found proof.

It was the pressure between shoulder blades that never quite left, the way birds lifted too early from brush, the scrape of weight where no wind moved. Whoever tracked them knew how to mask a trail almost as well as he did.

Ksena noticed his silence by midday.

"Are you all right?" she asked as they crossed the dry flats.

"Headache," he said.

It was a lie, but not a complete one.

He did not tell her about the follower yet. If he was wrong, he would only feed fear. If he was right, he needed one clean read before he acted.

"The next temple should be near this ridge line," Ksena said, checking a charcoal mark on her map strip. "You can wait outside if you want."

He glanced at her and shook his head. "I am coming in."

She smiled, relieved.

Behind a basalt outcrop, Maera flattened herself against stone and held her breath until they moved on.

Of course he had heard something, she thought. Trust Alcuin to hear cloth on rock from thirty paces.

She had returned from hunting to find him gone, exiled with the city girl everyone blamed and nobody understood. Maera had argued with elders, with family, with anyone who tried to stop her. Then she had packed and followed.

Now she watched him carry half the load while the ascendant walked beside him like she belonged there.

Maera hated the thought enough to taste iron.

She kept moving.

Alcuin found the first sign by late afternoon: a carved notch on deadwood at knee height. Not random. Deliberate. Someone wanted him to know he was being followed.

He showed no reaction and kept walking.

By sunset they saw smoke on the horizon.

Alcuin's pace changed first, then turned into a run.

Ksena chased him through scrub and loose stone, lungs burning.

They reached the village as light failed.

There was nothing left worth calling a village.

Timber frames had collapsed into black ribs. The central well had caved in. Bones lay in patterns that made clear this had happened fast and with heat no normal fire could produce. Even now, one half-buried wood store still smoldered.

Ksena bent over, hands on knees, trying to pull breath back into her chest.

"Survivors?" she asked.

Alcuin looked once around the perimeter and shook his head.

"At least a week old," he said. "Maybe more."

He knelt in the ash and whispered a short hunter prayer he had not spoken since childhood.

Ksena stood beside him and added her own words, quieter, uncertain, but sincere.

When they rose, both of them looked older.

"We should move," Alcuin said. "If anyone sees us here, they could blame you before asking questions."

Ksena nodded.

Above the ruins, on a ridge line, Maera watched with clenched hands.

If this was city work, she told herself, then the ascendant had brought death with her. If it was not, then something worse was moving across territory she barely knew.

Either way, Alcuin had to be pulled clear.

After dark she left two more signs where only he would notice: directional scratches and a mark for safe camp near water.

Alcuin saw both.

He said nothing to Ksena.

They made camp by a narrow river bend before full dark. It was early to stop, but the site was defensible and gave him options.

When the fire took, he pulled on his hunting harness.

"I am going to bring back game," he said. "Stay by the fire. Do not wander."

Ksena studied him for a beat too long.

"All right," she said. "Be careful."

After he left, she sat alone with the hiss of river water and the memory of burned roofs. Eventually she forced herself to move, filled a pot, and set it over coals.

If he came back empty-handed, at least they would have hot water and something warm in their hands.

In the dark beyond camp, Alcuin followed Maera's final marker toward a stand of thorn trees and stopped where the shadows deepened.

"Come out," he said.

No answer.

Then a shape moved between trunks.

Maera stepped into weak firelight from his hand-flame, jaw set, eyes sharp with relief and anger.

"You look terrible," she said.

"So do you," he replied.

For a moment neither spoke.

Then she pointed back toward camp.

"That girl is going to get you killed."

Alcuin's expression hardened.

"And if I leave her, she dies faster."

Maera opened her mouth to argue, then stopped when she saw he had already chosen.

"A village burned east of here," she said instead. "Not by raiders. Too hot. Too clean. I thought you should know before you walk into the next one."

Alcuin nodded once.

"Thank you."

Maera gave a bitter laugh.

"Do not thank me yet. I am still deciding whether to drag you home by force."

He almost smiled, then didn't.

"I cannot go home. Not now."

She looked away first.

When they separated, no promises were made.

Alcuin returned to camp with two small river fowl and a heavier silence than when he left.

Ksena looked up from the pot as he entered firelight.

"You took longer than usual," she said.

"Bad luck on the trail," he answered.

Another half-truth.

She accepted it for now.

They ate in near silence, the village smoke still lodged in both their minds, while somewhere out beyond the firelight three separate loyalties tracked the same path toward the temple.

They could see it prowling around outside their camp. It was a cat; it went hunting for food at night; they were rare, Ksena or Alcuin had never seen one in person before, Ksena had only seen them in books, they added onto the fire trying to scare it away, but as the fire grew it crawled in closer, they could clearly see it's bright orange fur, scarlet in the fires ruddy glow

They needed to do something else. It was getting closer as it circled them. Ksena called forth her power, but as she did so, the cat's eyes seem to spark and it's attention was centered on Ksena.

it rushed her, it was nimble and quickly darted around Alcuin and launching itself at Ksena, Ksena had just got this power and it was already being tested to defend herself, instead of a tiny fireball to knock the cat back, Ksena flung nearly everything she had at the cat, this close it would be an explosion and being this close Ksena realized she made a mistake as soon as her power left her fingertips, the fireball hit the cat midair and surrounded the cat completely in flames, Ksena collapsed onto one knee from exhaustion as her powers whirled around the cat, she waited for the explosion but it didn't happen, even as Alcuin tried to cover themselves knowing they were to close.

Instead, the cat leap in front of her out of the fire. The cat was still on fire, but it was the same as a full ascension outfit made of living flame. The cat wore the flame as a coat of amour; the explosion dissipated after the cat left it, leaving Ksena and Alcuin alone with the cat that was now preening itself sitting between them

The fire-cat circled once, then settled near the edge of the coals as if it had chosen them for the night.

Ksena kept one hand low and open until the animal finally touched her fingers with it's nose. Heat pulsed through her wrist, not like a burn, more like recognition. Alcuin watched in silence. If creatures like this were returning to the wild zones, then ascension energy was moving beyond cities and bloodlines. That changed the map in ways neither of them understood yet.

Alone at least, Alcuin turned his hand upwards and tried to summon flame, like he had seen Ksena do. The power pooled slowly at first and a burst of excitement as he let it free for the first time; the burst was enough to see him stumbling back in surprise, hitting his back against the wall, Ksena called out, he quickly snuffed the flame, closing his hand and letting the flames die out, not a moment to soon before Ksena opened the door to his room, Alcuin took a moment to gather his wits as the power still wanted to come out

It's nothing, I just tripped on my bag

Oh, I thought I felt my sister's power for a moment and I heard the bang so I came in

To what, protect me?

I was worried, that's all. Are you okay?

I'm fine, get out, and ask before you come in next time!

Ksena looked at Alcuin hurt by his words, 'sorry, I'm going' slowly she backed out of the room and Alcuin could hear her walk down the hall back to her own room

Alcuin collapsed onto the bed, he hit his pillow cursing himself for being s abrupt with her

Later, Ksena knocked on Alcuin's door and held out the ration tin without speaking.

He took it, then handed it back after one bite. "Half each," he said. The apology was clumsy, but real. They ate in the hallway and reviewed route options until fatigue blurred the symbols on the map. Before sleeping, Alcuin admitted he had almost lost control of the flame. Ksena only answered, "Tell me next time before it becomes a problem." He agreed.
