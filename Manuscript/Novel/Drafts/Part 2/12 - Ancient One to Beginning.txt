The old woman waited in a ruin that did not appear on city maps.

She looked fragile until Ksena stepped into range and felt the pressure around her, banked power held under deliberate restraint.

Alcuin stayed one pace behind, hand near knife, watching every shadow line.

"Sit," the woman said.

Ksena sat.

"You are not in the city," Ksena said. "Why?"

The woman gave a tired smile.

"Because the city fell long before its walls did."

Conversation started guarded and became impossible to stop.

The woman called herself one of the first generation after the war, old enough to remember which histories were cut from public record and which lies replaced them.

She spoke plainly. Ascension had begun as a survival method under invasion pressure. After victory, one faction wanted distributed stewardship while another wanted centralized control. Control won, and the crystal system was rewritten from enhancement into a governance mechanism.

"You were expelled because you resisted alignment lock," the woman told Ksena. "Not because you failed ritual."

Ksena felt the sentence physically.

"Then why not kill me?"

"Unknown variables are useful before they are dangerous," the woman said. "You were classified as useful."

Alcuin asked the question he had held since exile.

"Why am I involved?"

The woman looked directly at him.

"Because transfer pathways were never bloodline-exclusive. They were made exclusive."

She drew an old map in the dust, marking temples, relay sites, and one inactive chamber keyed to paired ritual.

"If you want proof, go there," she said. "If you want survival, stop walking where your father's watchers expect."

Before they left, she gripped Ksena's wrist and forced eye contact.

"They are counting your steps already."

At dawn Ksena and Alcuin reached the temple site.

From a distance it looked like a collapsed hill.

Up close, it still held structure: half-buried columns, one gate blown inward, inner corridors stripped by time.

At the core they found the hall, with top-ring statues in ceremonial ascendant form and lower-ring statues in practical hunter dress unmistakably tied to Alcuin's people, all facing inward toward a raised altar.

Alcuin's jaw tightened.

"So this is the official story," he said. "Gods above, everyone else below."

Ksena turned from altar and caught his wrist.

"That is not my story."

"Maybe not yours. Maybe theirs."

Distance opened between them and almost stayed there.

Ksena pulled him back by force of voice more than hand.

"I do not know what this room means," she said. "I know what you mean to me. Without you, I die in week one outside the wall."

He looked away, then back.

"Then help me not feel small in your history."

She nodded.

"Help me rewrite it."

At altar top they found paired hand depressions.

"Together," Alcuin said.

"Together," Ksena answered.

They set their palms on the stone. Nothing happened for a breath, then a pulse answered.

Heat surged through stone into bone. Ksena ignited first, thin flame lines tracing shoulders and spine. Current crossed into Alcuin's arms before he could pull free.

Ring lights came alive one by one.

Glyph bands turned.

Both of them saw fragmentary sequence through nerves instead of eyes: siege sky, falling fire, two peoples in one defensive line, then split under command pressure.

The lock released.

Ksena nearly collapsed. Alcuin caught her.

Their flames guttered and died together.

No visible burns.

Everything still changed.

Alcuin's ignition response shortened. Ksena's output stabilized but carried new strain cost. Both could feel it.

By dawn they left with one conclusion neither could avoid: the original ritual had been paired, the single-line control model came later, and someone had rewritten the access rules.

They camped in dry wash and reviewed implications until arguments ran out.

That night, while Ksena slept, Alcuin tested output in short bursts and nearly lost containment on third attempt.

By morning he could spark flame on command and felt like his own body had become unfamiliar terrain.

Kirk joined them at the rendezvous with telemetry updates and one problem larger than ritual politics: multiple high-atmosphere entries with unknown profiles.

They climbed the ridge and saw the first fire trails cut the sky, ships huge enough to make city towers look ornamental.

Ksena stared until her eyes hurt.

"Ancient enemy," she said.

Kirk lowered binoculars.

"Or someone using their old corridor." 

Neither answer helped.

They watched descent paths until the final trail faded. No broadcasts, no banners, and no friendly signal followed.

Alcuin folded map cloth flat on stone.

"We choose now," he said. "Hide and survive. Or move and learn."

Ksena looked from ship trails to temple map to the old woman's warning still burning in memory.

"We move," she said. "But not blind."

They set priorities: confirm fleet intent, track beacon origin, and gather records before city factions buried them again.

Before first light, they split immediate tasks. Estele would run village warning routes with Kirk while Ksena and Alcuin pushed for the next temple lead.

Kirk stepped aside to patch orbit and came back with rough coordinates hand-drawn across map cloth.

"North-west from here," he said. "Near the largest lake on this continent. Eight days on foot if weather holds."

Alcuin studied the marks. "And if weather does not hold?"

"Then you take the mountain edge and follow shoreline south to north," Kirk said. "You lose time, but not route."

Estele checked her own gear and gave Ksena a short nod.

"Warn villages first, answers second," she said. "Do not die chasing certainty."

Ksena wanted to argue, then did not. They needed both tracks active.

By sunrise they were already moving toward the nearest city that still kept archive access.

Ksena carried three things on that road.

A map that proved history had been edited.

A ritual change she did not yet understand.

And certainty that exile had ended.

This was now campaign.
