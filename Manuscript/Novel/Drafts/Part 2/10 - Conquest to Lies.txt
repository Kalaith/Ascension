On the second day with Estele, they stopped believing speed would save them.

The guide's pace was ruthless but efficient, cutting across stone shelves and dry gullies where tracks vanished quickly. By noon, Ksena's legs burned and Alcuin's patience was thinner than rope twine.

"You two wanted answers," Estele said without looking back. "Answers don't live beside comfortable roads."

Ksena almost replied, then froze when she noticed smoke ahead.

Not camp smoke.

Too dark. Too dense. Too straight.

Alcuin was already moving uphill for a clearer line of sight.

Estele grabbed his sleeve. "Slow. We look first."

They took the ridge in silence.

Below them, a village burned.

Flame struck from above in controlled waves, not from scattered huts catching by accident. Roof lines collapsed inward one block at a time. Livestock pens were already black frames. People were running toward the river cut and dying before they reached it.

Ksena saw the attacker and forgot how to breathe.

Kalani.

Her sister hovered over the village with fire streaming around her body like ritual dress turned weapon.

"No," Ksena whispered.

Alcuin looked at her, then back at the sky, and swore.

"Do not move," Estele hissed. "If she sees us, we die with them."

Ksena's knees hit stone.

She could not make her body do anything except watch while Kalani lifted one hand and dropped another white-hot strike into the square.

When it was done, Kalani turned and flew east without looking back.

No battle.

No warning.

Just execution.

They waited until smoke patterns changed from active burn to collapse heat before descending.

The first body Ksena reached was a woman curled around two children who had not survived under her.

Alcuin pulled her away before she touched the ash.

"Later," he said, voice rough. "We mark first. Then we bury."

Estele stood guard at the lane split and watched horizon lines.

"No patrol signatures yet," she said. "But we have maybe two hours before scavengers or soldiers."

They worked until dark, setting marker stones, digging a mass pit where the collapse made separation impossible, naming the dead where they could, and honoring the rest in silence.

They camped without fire.

Ksena sat against a stone outcrop with blood and soot dried on her hands.

When Alcuin passed her the water skin, her fingers brushed his and neither of them pulled away quickly enough to pretend it meant nothing.

A month ago, that closeness would have felt simple. Now it came with grief, exile, and futures both of them had already lost.

Alcuin kept first watch and did not ask if she was all right.

At second watch she finally spoke.

"I thought maybe she was controlled," Ksena said. "I thought maybe she had no choice."

Alcuin did not turn.

"Did that look like no choice?"

Ksena closed her eyes.

"No."

By dawn, grief had hardened into method.

If Kalani was acting under her father's command chain, they needed proof.

If she was acting alone, they needed to know why no one stopped her.

If humans were involved, they needed evidence before blame.

Shock could not be the plan.

They moved west to the nearest ruined city district by midday and read the damage patterns with more discipline than sleep allowed. Outer walls were mostly intact, inner blocks had blown outward from heat pressure, the armory quarter had been stripped before final collapse, and the administrative district had been scorched in directional strikes.

"This wasn't one-day chaos," Alcuin said. "This was staged conflict."

Ksena crouched beside a cracked marker slab and brushed soot from engraved lines.

"I can read part of this," she said. "Containment failure... emergency transfer... elder split..."

Estele looked over her shoulder.

"Elder split?"

Ksena nodded.

"If this date line is right, this happened during old war era, not after."

Alcuin sat back on his heels.

"So your city story is missing half the event."

"Or hiding it," Ksena said.

They searched until sunset and recovered one transport ledger fragment, two heat-warped command tags, and a broken directive plate that referenced restricted archive routes in another city to the north.

At camp that night, Ksena wrote three columns on cloth: known, suspected, and unverified.

Alcuin crossed out two of her assumptions and added one line under all three columns:

Confirm before acting.

She looked at him and nodded.

By morning they had a route: follow the archive reference north, avoid open ridges where Kalani or scouts could spot them, and use Estele's local contacts only where absolutely necessary.

At the first fork after sunrise, Estele stopped and pointed west.

"I peel off here for one day," she said. "I can warn two settlements and scrub your movement trace before city spotters lock this lane."

Alcuin frowned. "We move without guide through open country?"

"You move on the line we just set," Estele said. "I rejoin at relay house marker by second dusk. If I don't, assume compromised and continue north."

Ksena held her gaze, then nodded.

"Second dusk. Relay house marker."

Estele tapped two fingers to map cloth.

"Stay alive long enough for me to catch up."

As they packed, Ksena looked once more at the blackened skyline.

She had entered exile believing one clear villain would explain everything.

Now she had her sister as executioner, evidence of old internal fractures, and a world where every answer seemed designed to protect someone powerful.

Estele tightened her straps and pointed toward the next ridge.

"Move," she said. "The dead are not the only ones tracking us now."

They moved.

Behind them, ash lifted from ruined streets and disappeared into wind.

Ahead, the first city that still kept records waited beyond two days of hard ground and whatever command network her father still controlled once it learned Ksena had witnessed the burn.

She adjusted the carved bird hidden in her sleeve and kept walking.

If this war had always been built on edited history, then survival depended on finding the unedited version before someone burned that too.

They made one more stop before full night, a half-collapsed relay annex on the edge of an old industrial lane. Estele called it a "dead lung" station, once tied to regional pump pressure and now used mainly as shelter by whoever could hold it.

Ksena traced rusted pipework running through the wall and realized the lines still connected to something farther north.

"These feeds are intact," she said.

Estele nodded.

"Intact enough to fail catastrophically if someone forces output from central command without local balancing."

Alcuin looked between them.

"Meaning?"

"Meaning infrastructure is now weapon terrain," Estele said. "Not just villages and roads."

They found a chalkboard in side room where someone had left emergency maintenance notes in mixed script:

- purge vent before dawn,
- never trust gauge three,
- if pressure rises with dry line, suspect remote override.

Ksena copied all of it.

"This is the same pattern as the burn sites," she said. "Control from distance, consequence on people with no authority."

Alcuin rested spear against wall and rubbed his eyes.

"I used to think war meant armies."

"War means systems too," Ksena said.

They ate in darkness, no fire, and reviewed the cloth chart she'd started after the village attack:

Known.
Suspected.
Unverified.

Under known she added one new line.

Legacy infrastructure remains active enough to be leveraged.

Under suspected she added another.

Command may be using maintenance chokepoints to pressure settlements without open military action.

Estele read the entries and gave one short approving nod.

"Keep writing like that," she said. "People can argue stories. Harder to argue patterns."

At first light, they moved again.

The road ahead looked empty.

Ksena knew better now.

Nothing in this phase was empty.

Everything was either neglected, hidden, or actively used by someone pretending it wasn't power.
