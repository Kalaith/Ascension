General Hale reviewed the beacon packet again while the transport pierced cloud.

She did not need another read to remember the core facts. She needed another read to remind herself where certainty ended.

The signal had originated on a non-Earth world.

It was old.

It was degraded, but authentic.

And now, after years of travel, she was finally over the landscape that had sent it.

The first scans made everyone in command deck quiet.

One major city sat inside an energy barrier that outperformed anything Hale had expected to find here.

Outside that shield, population clusters were scattered, under-resourced, and vulnerable.

The beacon source did not align with the protected city.

That detail mattered more than every headline summary in fleet briefings.

Someone had asked for help, and someone else had kept power.

Hale called a closed planning session with Kirk, two operations chiefs, and legal.

"No direct strikes," she said. "No forced contact. No heroic improvisation unless civilians are dying in front of you."

Kirk leaned over terrain maps. "If we wait for perfect certainty, we lose initiative."

"If we move fast and wrong," Hale said, "we become the story that justifies every enemy narrative on this planet."

He held her gaze, then nodded once.

"Recon first," he said.

"Recon with extraction windows," Hale corrected.

Kirk launched in a light atmospheric craft before dawn and pushed low over broken ridgelines toward the beacon corridor.

At first, the mission looked clean.

Then alarms screamed: thermal lock, no platform signature, no warning transmission.

The strike hit his port side and turned the craft into burning fragments before he completed evasive roll.

Kirk ejected into red stone and hard wind, landed badly, and crawled to cover with one shoulder half-numb and his comm stack throwing intermittent static.

Through smoke and heat shimmer, he saw the attacker.

A woman suspended in flame.

She watched wreckage burn like it was routine work, then accelerated east and vanished over ridges.

By the time Hale received his partial burst, command expected one answer: return.

Instead Kirk sent coordinates and a short line.

"Continuing. Beacon trail still active."

Hale cursed once, quietly, then rerouted overhead sensors to follow him.

He scavenged what he could from crash debris and moved on foot through basalt cuts until he found two armed locals shadowing his route.

He called in trade-standard and got a fire strike for his honesty.

He answered with sedatives, not bullets.

When they woke, tension could have gone either direction.

The male introduced himself first, guarded and furious.

"Alcuin."

The woman followed with a stare that suggested she might kill Kirk anyway if the answers came wrong.

"Ksena."

The conversation shifted when Kirk described his attacker.

Ksena's expression broke for half a second.

"My sister," she said, voice flat from effort.

No one spoke for several breaths.

Then they did what survivors did when there was no room left for pride. They traded data: routes, hostile zones, temple sites, patrol patterns, and names that might still matter.

By dusk they had no trust, but they had a working map and one shared conclusion: whatever conflict had shaped this world was entering a new phase.

Kirk patched Hale through a weak relay and sent compressed notes: hostile ascendant confirmed, two local contacts cooperative under conditions, expanded diplomatic authority needed, and a controlled ground meeting required.

Hale's answer came back clipped.

"You have authority for conditional first contact. No unilateral escalation."

She launched in person the next morning with a small escort and kept formation visible and weapons cold on approach.

Ksena and Alcuin waited on a flat shelf above a dry river cut, both armed, neither pretending they were comfortable.

Hale stepped out alone first.

"General Hale," she said. "I am not here to claim territory."

Ksena replied without lowering her guard.

"Then why are you here?"

"Because someone on this world asked for help. Because something is hunting anyone who asks questions. Because I prefer alliances over body counts."

Alcuin gave a humorless breath that might have been a laugh.

"Good. We are currently outnumbered on body counts."

They spent three hours in hard negotiation. Terms were simple and strict: no restraints on guests, no forced relocation, shared intelligence with verification, and a mutual right to walk away if terms were broken.

Hale accepted all of it.

Then one of her spotters broke in over comms.

"Fast mover inbound. High heat signature."

The same woman Kirk had seen dropped from cloud cover in a spear of fire.

Kalani.

She struck before words could catch up.

The first blast split rock and threw everyone flat.

Escort teams returned disciplined suppressive fire that barely slowed her.

Ksena tried to call to her and got fire in reply.

Alcuin reached her first, dragged her behind cover, and took a glancing burn across his left arm.

Hale shifted teams to containment geometry instead of kill lanes.

"Net package now," she snapped.

Two launchers fired overlapping field nets tuned for extreme thermal load.

Kalani burned through the first, stalled in the second, and then shattered the containment field with a pulse of white heat that blinded the targeting sensors.

"Suppressing fire!" Hale shouted.

Three more nets fired. Kalani dodged two, incinerating a boulder to clear her line, but the third caught her ankle. She dragged the anchor line of a heavy transport ten meters across rock before the combined weight of two suppression teams finally pinned her.

She crashed into the river cut hard enough to fracture stone.

For ten seconds no one moved.

Then she rose inside a shrinking cage of light and screamed every curse Ksena had heard as a child.

"Traitor," Kalani spat at her. "You brought them here."

Ksena stepped forward before anyone could stop her.

"You burned villages," she said. "You killed people who never held a weapon against you."

Kalani laughed through blood.

"That is what power does when fear is useful."

Hale signaled med-techs and kept her rifle down.

"Secure transport," she ordered. "No sedative until biometrics stabilize."

Kirk moved to Ksena's side while the containment rig was anchored.

"You okay?"

"No," Ksena said. "But I am standing."

By late afternoon the battlefield was cleared, terms were rewritten to include detainee protocol, and everyone looked more tired than victorious.

Hale faced Ksena and Alcuin one last time before departure.

"We can continue this on the ground," she said, "but you will get better medical support and safer planning space aboard ship. Choice is yours."

Alcuin glanced at Ksena.

She looked at the containment transport where Kalani sat bound in light and fury.

Then she looked at the sky where human hulls waited above cloud.

"We come as guests," she said. "Under the terms we signed."

"Under the terms," Hale agreed.

They moved toward the pickup zone as evening wind pushed dust across the stones.

Above them, engines rolled like distant thunder.

The next stage would begin in steel corridors and briefing rooms instead of ruins and ridge lines.

Ksena did not mistake that for safety.

Only for a different kind of battlefield.

After Kalani's containment transport lifted, Hale delayed departure and forced one final on-ground session in a blasted shelter lane while med-techs treated burns and fractures.

No one wanted another meeting.

Hale scheduled it anyway.

"Adrenaline agreements are fragile," she said. "We lock terms while everyone is still angry and awake."

Ksena sat with ash on her sleeves and blood dried along one cuff that was not hers. Alcuin kept his burned arm in a cooling wrap and said little unless needed.

Kirk projected a quick incident map onto a cracked wall:

- contact point,
- Kalani attack vector,
- containment pattern,
- civilian risk envelope,
- fallback routes.

"We got lucky on geometry," he said. "If she had come ten degrees lower, this shelf becomes a casualty sink."

Hale looked at Ksena.

"What does this change for your side?"

Ksena answered without theatrics.

"It confirms open meetings are now active target zones. It confirms my sister is operating as strategic enforcement, not only emotional wildcard. It confirms that any alliance we build has to survive mid-negotiation attack."

Hale nodded.

"Good. What do you need from us next?"

"Three things," Ksena said.

"One: medical support for settlements hit by thermal strikes, no political strings.
Two: relay discipline and encrypted warning channels we can operate locally.
Three: restraint doctrine in writing so your teams don't become occupying force when panic spikes."

Hale answered immediately.

"Approved in principle. Draft details with Kirk."

Alcuin finally spoke.

"Add one more."

Everyone looked his way.

"Infrastructure priority mapping," he said. "If fleets hit, pumps and rails fail before armies. If we don't protect those nodes, your humanitarian aid becomes speeches."

Kirk gave him a sharp look of respect.

"We'll build a critical-node list tonight."

Hale turned to her legal officer.

"Write that into operational annex."

The officer blinked.

"Now?"

"Now."

By the time the session ended, the new draft terms included:

- detainee protocol under dual witness,
- civilian-site no-fire zones,
- joint verification before kinetic escalation,
- infrastructure-protection coordination.

As dusk fell, med-techs cleared Alcuin for transport with strict movement limits. Ksena refused sedation and accepted only burn gel and hydration salts.

At pickup zone, Hale walked with them to ramp and kept her voice low.

"You understand this gets worse before it gets useful," she said.

"I know," Ksena answered.

"Then don't confuse access to my ship with safety," Hale said. "It's just another terrain type."

Ksena gave a tired half-smile.

"That is exactly what I expected you to say."

They boarded under terms signed in dust, blood, and constraint.

Not trust.

Not friendship.

Working alignment.

For now, that was enough.
