From a distance the temple looked like a collapsed hill.

Up close it still held shape.

Half-buried columns rose out of windblown grit. One gate had fallen inward centuries ago, leaving a jagged opening large enough for two people side by side.

Alcuin lit a torch and stepped through first.

"Stay behind me until we know the floor," he said.

Ksena ignored the order for exactly six seconds, distracted by carved stonework under the dust.

"My ancestors built this," she whispered, fingers tracing a worn glyph.

"Your ancestors built a lot of traps," Alcuin muttered. "Watch your feet."

She nearly tripped on a fallen lintel as he said it.

He did not smile. She did not argue.

The interior corridors were long and mostly stripped, as if looters had taken anything portable and time had taken the rest. In one chamber the roof had collapsed, leaving a sloped exit route of packed dirt and broken masonry. Good to know if they needed a fast way out.

At the temple core they stopped.

A circular hall opened above them, ringed with statues.

Top tier: tall ascendant figures in ceremonial flame patterns.

Lower tiers: hunters, workers, families in practical dress that looked unmistakably like Alcuin's people.

All of them faced inward toward a raised central altar.

Alcuin's jaw tightened.

"So this is the story," he said quietly. "Gods above. Everyone else below."

Ksena turned from the altar and looked at him.

"That is not my story."

"Maybe not yours. Maybe theirs."

He stepped back from her hand.

The distance between them felt larger than the chamber.

Ksena moved to him anyway and caught his wrist.

"I do not know what this hall means," she said. "I know what you mean to me. Without you I would have died in the first week after exile."

He did not answer.

"I grew up in gardens," she continued. "You grew up hunting in weather that would have broken me. Out here you are stronger than I am in every way that kept us alive."

Alcuin looked away, then back.

"Then why does this place make me feel like a servant in your temple?"

Ksena stepped closer until he could not avoid her eyes.

"Because this place is old and wrong in ways we do not understand yet," she said. "Help me find the right part."

The anger in his face loosened, not gone, but no longer in command.

He nodded once.

They climbed the altar platform together.

At the top, the stone was smoother, worn by centuries of ritual contact. Two shallow depressions sat opposite each other, hand-width apart.

"Looks like paired activation," Alcuin said.

Ksena swallowed.

"Together?"

"Together."

They placed their hands.

Nothing.

Then the floor pulse came.

Heat surged up through the platform and into their arms. Ksena's fire ignited first, thin lines tracing her shoulders and spine like molten thread. Alcuin tried to pull back, but the current locked both of them in place.

Flame crossed from her skin to his wrists.

He braced for pain.

Instead he felt cold clarity, then pressure, then a sensation like doors opening inside his chest.

The chamber lights flickered to life in concentric rings.

Statues glowed.

Old glyph bands along the walls began to turn, each ring sliding against the next with grinding stone and buried mechanics. For one vertigo-struck moment, Alcuin saw images not with eyes but with nerves: war sky, falling fire, two peoples standing together, then splitting under fear and command.

Ksena cried out and nearly collapsed.

The lock released.

Alcuin caught her before she hit stone.

Their flames guttered and died at the same time.

They sank to the floor, both drenched in sweat, both shaking.

"Are you hurt?" he asked.

Ksena's pupils were wide and unfocused. She blinked hard until she could track his face.

"No burns," she said. "But something changed."

"Same here."

He flexed his fingers. Fire answered faster than before, denser, as if the delay between intent and output had shortened.

Ksena steadied her breathing and looked around the hall with new caution.

"This ritual was never meant for one person," she said. "It was always meant to be shared."

Alcuin followed her gaze across statues no longer silent.

"Then someone rewrote the rules," he said.

They rested only long enough to stand.

Neither trusted the temple to stay quiet.

By dawn they were back in open air, moving away from the ruins with a new burden: whatever the chamber had done, both of them were now tied into power systems they did not yet understand.

The path ahead had just narrowed.
