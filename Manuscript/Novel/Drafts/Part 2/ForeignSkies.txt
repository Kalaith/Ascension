Kirk flew his jet from the spaceship they had arrived in, he was on scouting duty they had come to this planet to help the natives, but where was still a bit of an unknown, they had a city on radar, so his first job was to find this city and report back on the outcome, was the signal coming from it, was there signs of war.
At the moment this planet didn’t seem that advanced, they had found satellites long since abandoned and destroyed, Kirk doubted if anything happened it happened recently, and maybe they had come too later, they had to find small tribes but as far as Kirk could see they hadn’t made it as far as agriculture, this mission was likely a waste of time
‘Warning’ a warning came up on Kirks screen, there was something coming at him and fast, it was a.. Fireball ‘oh shit’ kirk exclaimed it was too late to dodge and he hid the eject button, not a moment to soon before his plane exploded and his seat was sent flying, kirk grabbed with his parachute as he tumbled through the air, given it a yank he gripped the seat as the parachute unveiled and pulled out, once it was stable Kirk looked around, trying to work out if what had shot if was still around and who was it.. So much for being peaceful, he said. What looked like a girl floating in the air, shaking his head to see if it was a mirage. The girl, it was a girl, was coated and flames and just seemed to be suspended in the air.
Whoever it was, she was laughing at him, or what he assumed was laughter, before flying off, Kirk was thankful if that’s who destroyed his ship hadn’t thrown another one at him while he was a sitting duck in the sky, but it was silly to keep him alive, he would get his revenge on her somehow

She must have left him alive, so he could go back to his people and let them know she had destroyed the ship, it wouldn’t work, if she thought that was enough to scare them off, they had come here and going home wouldn’t happen easily, but now he knew the enemy and that this world was truly dangerous, it wouldn’t happen a second time.

Finally, coming in for landing, Kirk gathered his things. The seat included enemy gear, and he still had his radio available
‘Base, come in this is kirk, flight 083’ ‘Kirk this is headquarters, what happened your flight disappeared of the radar’
‘I was attacked, the ship was destroyed, I just got out in time’
‘We saw nothing else on the radar’
‘The projectile seemed to come from a humanoid form and not a plane’
‘A humanoid was on the ground and shot you down. Do you need an emergency evacuation?’
‘No, it seems the inhabitants here have a form of flight. After shooting me down, she headed north-east’
‘Kirk repeat, you saw a flying humanoid female who shot down your ship?
‘That’s correct, she was around 5’6, dark purple skin, female appearance. I didn’t catch her name though’
‘I am going to find the wreckage of my ship and see if I can get more supplies, and either continue towards the beacon location or head back’
‘Please head back to the ship, if there is aggressive inhabits we will need to get more data and plan’
‘Negative, I will continue to get more information. ill activate my beacon if I get in trouble’
‘ Sigh, be careful out there, and report any information. We are blind here’
‘Will do; kirk replied and turned his communicator off. Time to head towards the plane crash. He could see the smoke from here.


The focus stayed on Kirk's aerial scouting loss and hard proof of local hostility. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on Kirk's aerial scouting loss and hard proof of local hostility. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on Kirk's aerial scouting loss and hard proof of local hostility. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on Kirk's aerial scouting loss and hard proof of local hostility. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on Kirk's aerial scouting loss and hard proof of local hostility. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.

They kept returning to Kirk's crash and his report of hostile flight-capable targets, because delay now would only make the next confrontation worse.
