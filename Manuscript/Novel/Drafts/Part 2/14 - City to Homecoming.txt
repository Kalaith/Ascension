The city rose out of the plains like a practical answer to an old catastrophe.

Ksena stopped on the ridge and stared.

Its architecture carried echoes of her home but none of her city's vanity. Towers were broad and load-bearing, not ornamental. Gardens were terraced food systems, not decorative courts. Streets were designed for carts and foot traffic, not ceremonial procession.

Alcuin followed her gaze.

"This place expects famine, not applause," he said.

Ksena nodded.

"Mine expects obedience."

At the gate, guards crossed spears until screening protocols were complete.

"Names, origin, purpose," the lead guard said.

Alcuin answered first.

"Travelers requesting temporary permit for supplies and archive inquiry."

The guard's eyes moved to Ksena.

"Ascendant?"

"Exiled ascendant," she said.

A younger guard muttered a curse under his breath. The lead did not react.

"No open flame inside market quarter. No flight within walls. Weapons peace-tied. Violations end permit," he said.

"Understood," Alcuin replied.

They were assigned a one-day movement pass and a municipal guide named Ressa, who looked like she had done this for too long and trusted no one's first version of anything.

"You get market, lodging, and supervised records request," she said while leading them through checkpoint lanes. "You do not get military district, water command, or old council vaults."

"Why so strict?" Ksena asked.

"Because strict survived our last civil fracture," Ressa said.

Inside the walls, city life ran loud and unscripted. Public kitchens fed labor shifts by token, toolsmiths argued prices with irrigation crews, children carried message slates between craft rows, and two traders shouted over grain tariffs before laughing together while unloading the same cart. No one asked permission to breathe.

Ksena felt the difference in her chest before she had words for it.

Before archive hour, Ressa took them below street level through maintenance corridors where this city's age showed openly. Dust, exposed conduits, patched valves, and crews rebuilding systems piece by piece. It was less elegant than Ksena's home and more honest about the cost of staying alive.

At one dead lighting node, Kirk crouched to inspect an access panel and traced a blown regulator board hidden under dirt and soot. The fix was simple once identified. Within an hour, one dark lane lit for the first time in months and workers treated it like a festival.

Ressa watched the reaction and said nothing for a long time.

"Now you understand why we keep asking for old access rights," she said at last. "Not for prestige. For function."

Ressa lodged them in a narrow room above a baker's shop and arranged an evening appointment with civic historian Halven after Alcuin traded two worked pelts for expedited access.

Halven's archive smelled like dust, oil, and old ink.

He listened while Ksena described temple records, split traditions, and barriers used as political instruments. He interrupted only to request date anchors and route references.

When she finished, he opened a ledger that had been rebound so many times the spine looked like layered bark.

"Your two cities share founders," he said. "They diverged after the war over one question: whether ascension should be governed by distributed councils or controlled by a single ritual authority."

Ksena swallowed.

"My city teaches that alternative models collapsed on their own."

"Convenient history," Halven said.

He slid over three copied maps marked with old temple clusters, post-war migration lanes, and restricted heat-fracture zones.

"Take these," he said. "And do not cross glass plains at high sun unless you enjoy losing skin."

On the way out, Ressa gave Ksena a long, measuring look.

"You came here expecting simple answers," she said.

Ksena shook her head.

"I came expecting to be denied entry."

"That would have been easier for everyone."

"Including you?"

Ressa snorted. "Especially me."

Night fell hard while they reviewed notes in their lodging room.

Alcuin spread maps on the floorboards.

"We have updated routes, record confirmation, and one contact letter for the northern district," he said. "That's progress."

Ksena sat by the window and watched lantern lines move through streets that functioned without barriers or ritual control.

"It's also proof," she said. "Another model survived."

At dawn they renewed permit long enough to depart through east gate.

Ressa met them at checkpoint and handed Ksena a sealed slip.

"Show this if northern wardens stop you," she said. "It confirms you are approved researchers, not reconnaissance assets."

Ksena accepted it with both hands.

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. Bring back evidence worth the paperwork."

They stepped out into open country before midday.

Behind them the gate cycled for the next caravan, ordinary as weather.

Ksena looked back once.

"One day," she said, "I want my city to run on agreements instead of fear."

Alcuin adjusted his pack and kept walking.

"Then we stay alive long enough to make fear expensive," he said.

She followed.

For the first time since exile, she carried not only anger but a working blueprint.

When the guard said one of the visitors was ascendant, Mayor Mathieu almost canceled the meeting.

When the guard added that the group also included an unknown outsider and a local male, he changed his mind.

Unusual groups carried leverage.

He met them in the council chamber with hospitality arranged and exit routes quietly secured.

"Welcome," he said, hands open. "I am Mayor Mathieu."

Ksena answered first.

"Thank you for receiving us."

She introduced Alcuin, then Kirk, the human scout.

Mathieu's expression did not change, but his aides took notes faster.

Once guards withdrew to corridor distance, he asked the only question that mattered.

"Why are you here?"

Ksena did not hide exile status.

"I failed a ritual in my city and was expelled. We are tracking temple records and old governance splits."

Kirk leaned in when prompted.

"My expedition responded to a distress beacon traced to this region. The signal referenced external hostile contact. We need source access and archive correlation."

Mathieu sat back.

"We did not transmit any recent distress call," he said. "But there is a sealed municipal chamber containing old beacon equipment. It has remained inaccessible for years."

Kirk's focus sharpened.

"Locked how?"

"Legacy seal keyed to ascendant signature," Mathieu said, eyes flicking to Ksena. "Or so records claim."

He offered rest, food, and a guided visit at first light.

Kirk wanted to push immediately. Ksena accepted delay.

Later, with only the three of them in guest quarters, Alcuin said what all three were thinking.

"He is helpful because he wants something."

Ksena nodded.

"So do we."

The next morning Mathieu escorted them through lower civic corridors beneath administrative district. The sealed chamber sat behind reinforced stone doors etched with obsolete municipal marks.

"If the lock opens," Mathieu said, "we all learn something. If it doesn't, we lose one morning and keep our assumptions."

Ksena placed her hand on the plate.

Heat spread through the old mechanism.

The seal released with a dry metallic click.

Inside, dust lay thick over console racks and signal arrays long disconnected from city grid. Kirk moved carefully through equipment rows, photographing, tagging, and restoring power cell by cell.

"Someone kept this system maintained intermittently," he said after checking wear patterns. "Not active, but not abandoned."

Mathieu frowned.

"By whom?"

"Good question," Kirk said.

They recovered a partial outbound log stack and one routing map fragment pointing toward uplink relays outside current municipal boundaries.

That made the room much more dangerous.

Then Kirk found a secondary record partition buried under corrupted indices.

"There is another message," he said. "Not transmission queued. Archived manually."

The projection rose in unstable light. A woman in ascendant fire, older dialect, war fatigue in every line of her face.

"My name is Ksera," she said. "If this recording remains, then command was taken by Zvera and the priest faction. They reclassified ascension as restricted inheritance and began erasing distributed temple access."

Ksena went rigid at the name.

Kirk kept the playback running while Mathieu's aides stood in stunned silence.

The recording continued: city purges, temple destruction, barrier creation, and one final warning that power had been consolidated through fear and selective ritual control.

When the image ended, no one in the room moved for several breaths.

By midday, the chamber was locked again and data copies secured under dual custody.

Mathieu requested full file transfer.

Ksena refused full release and offered a narrow extract under witness protocol.

The mayor's tone cooled.

"You ask access in my city and then restrict municipal review."

Ksena met his gaze.

"We share verifiable findings. We do not hand over raw strategic data while chain-of-command risk is unknown."

Negotiation tightened for an hour, but final terms were signed anyway: a joint review panel, limited archive release, and a three-day research permit extension with movement restrictions.

When they left chamber level, Mathieu stopped beside the stairwell.

"You are not naive," he said to Ksena.

"Neither are you," she replied.

He gave a thin smile.

"Good. Naive people do not survive this phase."

That evening in lodging, Kirk decrypted part of the recovered index and found what he had hoped and feared.

"Relay chain extends beyond known city grids," he said. "Whoever maintained beacon infrastructure planned for delayed recipients."

Alcuin rolled the map fragment flat.

"Meaning this was never one desperate signal. It was a network."

Ksena looked at the signed municipal terms on the table.

"Then we need this mayor cooperative for now," she said. "And watched."

At departure, Mathieu handed them a sealed travel writ for northern checkpoints.

"For smoother transit," he said.

Ksena accepted it.

"For mutual utility," she answered.

He laughed once.

"Exactly."

They left the city with usable data, a conditional partner, and one confirmed truth: old distress systems were still active by design, and whoever controlled the remaining nodes could steer the next war before most people even understood it had started.

Alcuin had rehearsed the speech all morning and forgot every line when he saw his village gate.

A year ago he had walked out as an exile.

Now flame moved under his skin when he breathed too hard.

The scouts recognized his face first and his ascended aura second. By the time he reached the outer posts, half the village had gathered with spears lowered and eyes fixed on him like he might be both miracle and threat.

The elder and head hunter stepped forward together.

"State your purpose," the elder said, voice formal and thin.

"To speak the truth before rumor does it badly," Alcuin answered.

The head hunter stared at his hands where faint heat shimmered over callused knuckles.

"Alcuin?" she asked.

"Yes."

Silence held. A child peering from behind a drying rack dropped a toy spear and scrambled back into the shadows. The sound was small, but it echoed like a shout.

Then the elder gestured toward his tent.

"Inside."

They sat on opposite mats while rain tapped hide roofing overhead. No one touched the tea.

Alcuin started with exile, then temple routes, then the ancient records he and Ksena had uncovered.

He did not embellish.

He explained that ascension for city-born lines had been reduced to activation by ritual, while for tribal lines it required power transfer. He explained that the crystal system in the city did more than awaken power. It enforced control. He explained what happened to villages that learned too much too quickly.

The elder listened without interrupting, but his jaw tightened at every mention of hidden history.

When Alcuin finished, the head hunter spoke first.

"If this is true, why tell us now?"

"Because two people cannot fight a system built over centuries," Alcuin said. "Because if we do nothing, they will eventually burn every village that could produce opposition."

The elder folded his hands.

"And your offer?"

"Voluntary ascension training," Alcuin said. "No coercion. No bloodline gatekeeping. No one forced."

The elder looked toward the tent flap where shadow movement showed villagers crowding close outside.

"You ask us to gamble survival on a power we were taught to fear."

"I know," Alcuin said. "If I were in your seat, I would hesitate too."

The head hunter leaned forward.

"If we refuse?"

"Then we keep sharing warning routes and evacuations," Alcuin said. "I did not come to demand obedience."

That answer shifted the room, not enough for trust but enough for negotiation.

By dusk the elder called a full council at the central fire ring. Alcuin stood before hunters, healers, elders, and apprentices while rain smoke drifted low.

He demonstrated controlled flame output only once, then put it out immediately.

"This is not a crown," he said. "It is responsibility with cost."

Questions came hard.

Would ascension erase identity?

Would children be pressured?

Could city forces detect new ascendants?

Could the process be reversed?

Alcuin answered what he knew and said "I do not know" when he did not.

That earned him more ground than any display of power.

At the end, the elder announced a provisional decision: no mass adoption, no public declarations, and only a small volunteer cohort screened by the village council, trained off-site, and observed by two neighboring tribes.

"We move slowly," the elder said. "If this power is freedom, it will survive scrutiny."

Alcuin bowed his head.

"That's fair."

When the meeting broke, old friends approached in hesitant groups. Some clasped his forearm. Some only nodded. A few avoided him entirely.

It hurt less than he expected.

On his way out, the head hunter caught him near the storage sheds.

"You changed," she said.

"Everyone does."

"Not like this."

He gave her a tired half-smile.

"I did not come back to be worshipped or forgiven. I came back because this village still matters to me."

She studied him for a long moment, then handed him a wrapped bundle.

Dried meat, water flasks, fresh bandage roll.

"For the road," she said. "Tell Ksena we are not her enemies unless she makes us so."

"She won't."

He left before dawn, running the old forest path until mist burned off and plains opened ahead.

Behind him, his village had not transformed overnight.

It had done something harder.

It had agreed to think, argue, and choose under pressure.

Alcuin decided that was enough for a first return.
