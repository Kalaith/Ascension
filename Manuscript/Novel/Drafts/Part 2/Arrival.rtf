\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Giant balls of fire approached from the skies, as they got closer ships emerged from the fire, Ksena had never heard of anything like this, Ksena couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t tell what the ship was made off, but it was massive, nearly bigger than the city of her birth, Alcuin also stared at the ship slack jawed, it must be even more of a surprise for him, he hadn\u8217\'92t seen a lot of technology in the tribe if any, and this ship was raining fire from the skies as it came down, at least it was far away, Ksena mumbled, but we should head further away}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Alcuin nodded and actually started into a small trot, Ksena kept up with him, but she hoped he didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t want to keep up this pace for long, the outside world was so tiring, with all the walking and dangers and now giant ship coming out of the sky, why was this all happening now, and why did she have to be a part of it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Of course maybe these were the ancient enemy all along, maybe they had somehow stopped the ritual and now coming, Ksena shivered whoever was in the ship would be just as advanced or more than her own people, did they come as friend or foe, her only choice was to follow what the ancient said and get her ascension ritual done, if it worked she would have a way of fighting, regardless of who the enemy was even if her family was controlled she would save and protect them}}
