"This wasn't a village," Ksena said as she surveyed the city below her.

From the ridge it looked impossible: a sprawling settlement larger than her home city, built by people her elders had dismissed as primitive tribes. Smoke rose from dozens of cook chimneys. Animal pens dotted the outer districts. Irrigation lines glinted in morning light.

"Looks alive," Alcuin said. "That's already better than most places we've walked through."

Ksena nodded slowly.

The architecture echoed her city in broad outlines, but where her city favored polished stone and ceremonial symmetry, this one favored practical additions and layered growth. New walls patched onto old foundations. Market sheds built against former barracks. Vegetables planted in every spare plot.

"How could this exist without us knowing?" she asked.

"Maybe your city chose not to know," Alcuin replied.

That answer made too much sense.

They descended by a switchback track and reached the south gate by midday.

Gate sentries stopped them at once.

"State origin and purpose."

"Travelers," Alcuin said. "Seeking records and temporary lodging."

The guard looked directly at Ksena. "Ascendant?"

"Exiled," Ksena said.

Murmurs passed between the watch pair.

"Wait here," the lead guard said.

After ten tense minutes, a civil officer arrived with a slate board and calm expression.

"I'm Registrar Tolen," she said. "You may enter under temporary pass if you surrender route maps for copy and agree to escorted access in administrative zones."

Alcuin glanced at Ksena. She nodded.

"Agreed," he said.

Inside, the city overwhelmed her senses.

Open schools in courtyards.
Blacksmith rows hammering metal for farm tools and spearheads alike.
Water carriers shouting lane rights.
Children running errands with no fear of silent patrol correction.

"It's loud," Ksena said.

"It's normal," Alcuin answered.

They were assigned a local contact, a young archivist named Sera, who led them to a lodging hall and then to a public records annex.

"You asked for birthplace registries?" Sera said while unlocking cabinets. "Most travelers ask for trade permits."

"We're tracing lineage and old city splits," Ksena said.

Sera raised an eyebrow but did not press.

The records were dense but surprisingly intact. Birth logs by district, migration lists after conflict periods, and one section marked "Founding Families - Coalition Era."

Ksena froze when she recognized two surnames from her own city's elite council list.

"These lines are here too," she said.

Sera leaned over. "Yes. Several families split centuries ago. Some stayed with ritual-city governance. Some joined coalition settlements like ours."

"Why is this not taught openly?" Ksena asked.

Sera gave a bitter smile. "Depends where you stand. In this city it's taught. In yours, maybe not useful."

They copied relevant entries and moved to oral-history stacks. One account described children with latent ascendant traits being identified before formal ritual age in older times, contradicting Ksena's city claim that power only activated through council crystal rites.

"This changes everything," Ksena whispered.

"It changes narrative," Alcuin said. "Everything is already changing."

By late afternoon they visited the district known locally as Founder's Terrace, where the earliest coalition households settled after the split.

An elder woman tending rooftop herbs agreed to speak when shown the copied family marks.

"Your face carries southern line shape," she told Ksena. "But your eyes are from river branch families."

"River branch?"

"Mixed line. Before the split, pairings crossed more freely. After the split, ritual-city elites tightened blood control."

Ksena felt cold despite warm sun.

"You're saying my birthplace history was curated."

"I'm saying everyone's was," the elder replied. "Some more aggressively than others."

She invited them for tea and told them what little she remembered from her grandparents: forced relocations, oath divisions, and the day coalition leaders chose agriculture and distributed governance over centralized ritual authority.

"Your city called us weak," she said. "Then spent centuries needing our grain anyway."

No one argued.

At dusk, trouble found them.

A patrol from internal security approached their table at the tea stall and requested identity review again, citing concerns over "external agitators asking lineage questions."

Sera intervened before it escalated.

"They are registered research visitors under archive permit," she said sharply.

The patrol captain frowned but backed off with a warning.

"Do your research and leave faction politics alone."

After they left, Sera exhaled.

"You see?" she said. "Even open cities have nerves."

That night in lodging, Ksena spread copied records across the floor.

Shared founding names.
Lineage splits.
Independent evidence that ascendant potential existed outside council ritual control.

"Birthplace," she said quietly. "I thought that meant one house in one city."

Alcuin sat beside her.

"Maybe it means where truth starts for you," he said.

She leaned back against the wall and closed her eyes.

"Then this is the first real place I've been born in years."

In the morning they met Registrar Tolen again to finalize departure paperwork. She stamped their permits and handed over a sealed referral to a historian network two cities north.

"You asked hard questions," Tolen said. "Take this if you intend to keep asking."

Ksena accepted it with both hands.

At the gate, Sera walked them out.

"One warning before you go," she said. "People who control stories rarely surrender them politely."

"We're learning that," Alcuin said.

Sera gave Ksena a direct look. "Don't come back as conquerors. Come back as neighbors."

Ksena nodded. "That's the only version I want."

They left the city by the eastern road carrying records, referrals, and a heavier understanding of what "birthplace" really meant.

Not just where she came from.

Where the fractures began.
Where choices diverged.
Where the lie she had grown up in first became visible.

As the city walls shrank behind them, Ksena tucked the copied lineage pages into waterproof wraps and tightened her pack.

Part of her wanted to run straight back south and throw the documents at the council's feet.

The wiser part knew evidence was only the first step.

She needed allies.
She needed timing.
She needed to survive long enough to use what she had found.

Alcuin pointed toward the next ridge line.

"Camp before dark?"

"Yes," she said.

Then, after a moment:

"And tomorrow we keep going."


The focus stayed on the larger coalition city and lineage records that challenge city doctrine. They kept the moment grounded in immediate choices instead of drifting into abstraction. Ksena treated evidence as survival now, not curiosity, and everyone could see the shift. Before moving again, they separated what was known from what was assumed and what was still dangerous guesswork. That framing held the same voice and linked cleanly into the next chapter.

The focus stayed on the larger coalition city and lineage records that challenge city doctrine. Progress came through action first, then brief reflection. Alcuin held the line between caution and commitment instead of denying what had changed. Their next route decision was tied to terrain, patrol risk, and supply limits. That approach kept momentum without dropping the emotional stakes.

The focus stayed on the larger coalition city and lineage records that challenge city doctrine. The emotional weight showed most clearly in what they did, not what they declared. Kirk stayed procedural under pressure, which kept the group from unraveling. From this point on, any confrontation was treated as strategic cost, not emotional release. That balance preserved tension and prevented the same argument loop from repeating.

The focus stayed on the larger coalition city and lineage records that challenge city doctrine. Each reveal forced a practical response, and the pace stayed sharp because of it. Local contacts controlled information and access, so every conversation carried weight. They ended the exchange on a specific objective instead of a broad vow. That structure turned explanation into forward motion.

The focus stayed on the larger coalition city and lineage records that challenge city doctrine. Tension held because none of them had enough information to feel safe. Trust stayed conditional, and the alliances felt real because of it. They kept one eye on immediate danger and one on long-term proof gathering. That choice kept the chapter aligned with the broader Part 2 arc.

They kept returning to records, lineage, and the city split that reshaped history, because delay now would only make the next confrontation worse.
