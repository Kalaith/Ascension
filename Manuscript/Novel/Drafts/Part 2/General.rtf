This was supported in that the cities had close structural relationships, but the hunters\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92 city was much older.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They would need to make contact discreetly, maybe something had happened, and they had been attacked and was under some threat that stopped them, the other city was under a shield, that made their own shields seem childish, the scientist reported that all the ships guns could be fired and not even dent the shield so he doubted they would be the ones to visit first}}
