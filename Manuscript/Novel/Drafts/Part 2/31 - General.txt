The general looked over the reports, and out the widow of his ship to the planet below, it was a strange planet, while it had a civilization older than humans, a species that already had ships stronger and faster than anything the humans had, the species was not actually space faring; they had everything they needed to leave the stars and beyond but didn't act on it, instead staying in one advanced city, but this planet was sending out a distress signal asking for help, and the distress signal came not from the advanced city, it came from the species on the planet that looked like it was still in the hunter/gather relationship apart from one large city where the signal was coming from; the scientist estimated that the signal has actually been sent out for at least a few hundred years, so what had happened, a secondary uprising perhaps? and the other city eventually moved. This was supported in that the cities had close structural relationships, but the hunters' city was much older.

Humans had found the signal, as the first sign of intelligent life humans had gone into an euphoria of waiting to answer it, first interaction and helping while at it, but now the situation was more confusing.. and the general had a media appointment at 15:00 hours to report on the state of things, but this didn't appear to be a clear-cut situation, interacting with a species that was not seafaring, but it's where the signal originated from, but it was old but based on the distress signal had also taught them the language and the hunter/gather spoke a version.

They would need to make contact discreetly, maybe something had happened, and they had been attacked and was under some threat that stopped them, the other city was under a shield, that made their own shields seem childish, the scientist reported that all the ships guns could be fired and not even dent the shield so he doubted they would be the ones to visit first

General Hale ended the briefing with one rule: no operation proceeded without a civilian extraction path.

Kirk argued for speed. Ksena argued for precision. Hale forced both into the same timeline and signed off only when the plan had fallback windows for failure. It was slower than anyone wanted, but it was the first plan in weeks designed to survive first contact with reality.
