Kalani didn't think it would be this easy to get rid of her sister, as if she was going to share this power with anyone, it didn't even take much, a good luck wish, a hand grasp and sending her power flowing through into Ksena and sitting back and watching her sister ritual backfire, one failed attempt, Kalani wasn't sure why it even worked, she had a theory but she didn't have anyone else to practice it on, and even if it did, it would might have clued other people onto it

She was sure Ksena would have been just as powerful as her, enough to sense them although Kalani doubted she could do much about it either, she saw an unwilling pawn for them, eventually she would overturn it, but it was difficult to hide anything from them, while they couldn't mind read, answers had to be 100% truth and she had to do what they command.

Kalani was quite happy Ksena had been exiled, she keep a track of her sister's progress out in the wilds, her sister is doing exactly what she would have expected, looking for an answer, and when she found it Kalani would be there

The added conflict with these new creatures didn't even bother her. They had powerful technology but still easy to shoot out of the sky and their invasions have kept the elders busy and given Kalani many chances to go out into the world; they were nothing insects; she was sure she could wipe them out; she had been testing the descriptive uses of her powers, that tribe died so easily, one wave of her hand and the entire tribe was roast, it had been too easy, sure she had been admonished for it, but by the time she was finished talking to the elders they had come around a little, the savages would only get in the way in the next war and they needed to be prepared to fight these humans and burn their ships to the ground.

Kalani watched the council chamber empty and smiled only when the doors sealed behind the last elder. They still believed they were governing beside her. They had no idea they were being measured for usefulness.

From the upper balcony she could see the city patrol lines tightening around every gate and supply lane. Good. Fear made people predictable. She sent one final order through the crystal network and felt the response ripple back through hundreds of minds. If Ksena wanted to challenge her, she would have to do it on a board Kalani had already arranged.

'Sis-' the words died in her mouth, that was definitely her sister flying above the village they headed towards, something beckoned her to be quiet as she watched her sister, maybe they were out looking for her, to finally bring her home, but it didn't seem to be the case, in one horrifying moment Ksena watched her sister raise her hand, summoning a large amount of fire and with a casual flick of her wrist sending it down on the unsuspecting village below, Ksena could hear the screams as her sisters power reached the ground in the center of the village and exploded, burning everything in the area, Alcuin screamed and rushed towards the village, but Ksena was too shocked to move, she thought this was the humans doing, not her own flesh and blood, how could her sister do that to the village, what had they done to deserve it, she wanted to reach out to her sister but she couldn't lift her hand or take a step, and her sister satisfied with her work, sped off back to home.

Ksena couldn't look at him. The village was destroyed, bodies laid still, charred and smoldering, the air smelt of burnt flesh and it was her sisters doing, the other village was that her sisters doing as well.

That night they camped without a fire.

Alcuin sat awake with his back to a stone outcrop while Ksena stared into darkness where the village used to stand. Neither of them said Kalani's name again. They did not need to. By sunrise, grief had hardened into direction. If the city had done this through Kalani, then every next step had to be about evidence, allies, and timing. Shock could not be the strategy.

the village didn't exist now, where once stood a proud tribe was nothing but a depression in the ground and the charred remains of houses, animals and bodies, what had caused this, was it the ships she had seen in the sky are they the real ancient enemy had they come to invade and take another go at destroying their people, Ksena spent the day with Alcuin helping to bury the dead, they had at least found some shovels buried under the rubble to help them; the task brought them a little closer together, him because she was helping to bury the dead, and her because he let her work beside him,

after saying their prayers they both headed off, they were tired and needed to make camp, but unspoken they didn't want to do this near the village, only when they were we'll passed did they collapse, they didn't even get a fire lit for food, neither had an appetite

they collapsed and sleep we'll into the following morning

By the time they finished burying the last body, both of them were shaking from exhaustion.

Ksena planted a marker stone at the edge of the ruined square and swore she would return with names, not rumors. Alcuin did not promise comfort. He promised movement. They left before sunset carrying less food, less certainty, and one shared conclusion: whatever was happening between the city and the ritual was larger than any single attack.

Ksena kept repeating the same thought while she stared over the blackened stone.

If the humans didn't level the city, what did?

Smoke still drifted from broken towers in thin ribbons, too little for a fresh bombardment, too much for old ruin. The damage pattern made no sense. Some blocks were shattered outward as if something had exploded inside the city, while outer walls stood mostly intact.

Alcuin crouched beside a fallen marker and ran his fingers over the edge.

"Heat cracked this from within," he said. "Not impact from above."

Ksena shook her head. "Humans have weapons we don't understand."

"True," Alcuin said. "But they also leave signatures. Burn lines. Metal fragments. We saw what their weapons do at the barrier. This looks different."

She hated that he sounded convincing.

"Then my people did this?" she asked, voice rising. "You think they burned their own city?"

"I think someone with ascendant-level power was involved," he said carefully. "That's all I'm saying."

"That's not all you're saying."

He looked up at her, jaw tight.

"You want a clean enemy because clean enemies are easier to hate."

The words hit harder than she expected.

Ksena turned away and climbed over a collapsed beam into what used to be a meeting courtyard. Ash coated everything. A statue lay cracked in two, face melted smooth by heat.

She kicked at a shard and immediately regretted it as pain shot through her toe.

"Damn it."

Alcuin moved to her side. "Sit."

"I'm fine."

"Sit."

She sat.

While he checked her foot for injury, she watched the horizon where human ships had once crossed this region. Could another ship group have come unseen? Could someone be lying to them both?

"You think I'm lying," Alcuin said without looking up.

"I think you're choosing a theory that hurts less for you."

He laughed once, humorless. "How does this hurt less?"

She didn't answer.

He wrapped a strip of cloth around her bruised toe anyway and tied the knot with more force than necessary.

"There," he said. "Now you can walk and argue at the same time."

Despite herself, she almost smiled.

They resumed searching.

In the old records district they found scorched tablets fused together, unreadable. In the armory quarter they found racks emptied long ago, but a few warped blade forms remained in ash, suggesting defenders had mobilized before collapse.

"Not surprise attack," Alcuin said. "Prepared engagement."

"With who?"

"Unknown."

That was the answer they kept returning to.

Near dusk they reached what looked like an administrative vault with partial walls still standing. Ksena found a fractured display slab under debris and brushed off enough surface to reveal etched lines.

She squinted at the script.

"I can read pieces," she said. "Evacuation directive... containment failure... council split..."

Alcuin froze. "Council split?"

"Yes."

"Like Ktira said."

Ksena stared at the slab harder, forcing more meaning from damaged text.

"There's a date mark. It lines up with the war period from the projection."

She swallowed.

"If this is authentic, then the city didn't fall in one battle. It broke from inside first."

Alcuin sat back on his heels. "Which means your city's story was incomplete."

"Or manipulated."

They packed the slab fragment carefully with cloth and rope.

Night came cold and fast. They camped in a half-collapsed archway sheltered from wind, keeping fire minimal. Ksena could not sleep.

Every time she closed her eyes she saw her mother's face at exile, controlled and distant, then this city shattered by forces she could no longer name with confidence.

At second watch she woke Alcuin early.

"I keep thinking about the humans," she admitted.

"Still think they did this?"

"I don't know."

He sat up and pulled his blanket tighter.

"That's progress."

"You're impossible."

"And you're stubborn. Works out."

She stared into the low coals.

"If my people did this, what does that make me?"

Alcuin answered immediately. "Not responsible for what you were never told."

"It still runs through me."

"So does choice."

The wind shifted, carrying old ash and damp stone smell through the ruined arch.

By dawn they agreed on next steps.

Collect evidence where possible.

Avoid final conclusions too early.

Find a living source in the nearby city who might know collapse records.

Keep tensions between them from becoming permanent fractures.

As they packed, Ksena looked once more at the shattered skyline.

She had arrived wanting one simple answer.

Humans did it.

Or elders did it.

Or enemies did it.

Instead she was leaving with something harder.

Layers.

Lies inside lies, stories built to hide older stories.

And somewhere inside those layers sat the truth she needed, whether she was ready for it or not.

Ksena rewrote their list three times before she was satisfied: what they knew, what they suspected, and what would kill them if they guessed wrong.

When Alcuin reviewed it, he crossed out two assumptions and replaced them with one instruction. "Confirm before acting." She nodded and folded the page into her jacket. They could survive fear. They could not survive building plans on the same lies that had already burned a village.
