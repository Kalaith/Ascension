Ksena kept repeating the same thought while she stared over the blackened stone.

If the humans didn't level the city, what did?

Smoke still drifted from broken towers in thin ribbons, too little for a fresh bombardment, too much for old ruin. The damage pattern made no sense. Some blocks we're shattered outward as if something had exploded inside the city, while outer walls stood mostly intact.

Alcuin crouched beside a fallen marker and ran his fingers over the edge.

"Heat cracked this from within," he said. "Not impact from above."

Ksena shook her head. "Humans have weapons we don't understand."

"True," Alcuin said. "But they also leave signatures. Burn lines. Metal fragments. We saw what their weapons do at the barrier. This looks different."

She hated that he sounded convincing.

"Then my people did this?" she asked, voice rising. "You think they burned their own city?"

"I think someone with ascendant-level power was involved," he said carefully. "That's all I'm saying."

"That's not all you're saying."

He looked up at her, jaw tight.

"You want a clean enemy because clean enemies are easier to hate."

The words hit harder than she expected.

Ksena turned away and climbed over a collapsed beam into what used to be a meeting courtyard. Ash coated everything. A statue lay cracked in two, face melted smooth by heat.

She kicked at a shard and immediately regretted it as pain shot through her toe.

"Damn it."

Alcuin moved to her side. "Sit."

"I'm fine."

"Sit."

She sat.

While he checked her foot for injury, she watched the horizon where human ships had once crossed this region. Could another ship group have come unseen? Could someone be lying to them both?

"You think I'm lying," Alcuin said without looking up.

"I think you're choosing a theory that hurts less for you."

He laughed once, humorless. "How does this hurt less?"

She didn't answer.

He wrapped a strip of cloth around her bruised toe anyway and tied the knot with more force than necessary.

"There," he said. "Now you can walk and argue at the same time."

Despite herself, she almost smiled.

They resumed searching.

In the old records district they found scorched tablets fused together, unreadable. In the armory quarter they found racks emptied long ago, but a few warped blade forms remained in ash, suggesting defenders had mobilized before collapse.

"Not surprise attack," Alcuin said. "Prepared engagement."

"With who?"

"Unknown."

That was the answer they kept returning to.

Near dusk they reached what looked like an administrative vault with partial walls still standing. Ksena found a fractured display slab under debris and brushed off enough surface to reveal etched lines.

She squinted at the script.

"I can read pieces," she said. "Evacuation directive... containment failure... council split..."

Alcuin froze. "Council split?"

"Yes."

"Like Ktira said."

Ksena stared at the slab harder, forcing more meaning from damaged text.

"There's a date mark. It lines up with the war period from the projection."

She swallowed.

"If this is authentic, then the city didn't fall in one battle. It broke from inside first."

Alcuin sat back on his heels. "Which means your city's story was incomplete."

"Or manipulated."

They packed the slab fragment carefully with cloth and rope.

Night came cold and fast. They camped in a half-collapsed archway sheltered from wind, keeping fire minimal. Ksena could not sleep.

Every time she closed her eyes she saw her mother's face at exile, controlled and distant, then this city shattered by forces she could no longer name with confidence.

At second watch she woke Alcuin early.

"I keep thinking about the humans," she admitted.

"Still think they did this?"

"I don't know."

He sat up and pulled his blanket tighter.

"That's progress."

"You're impossible."

"And you're stubborn. Works out."

She stared into the low coals.

"If my people did this, what does that make me?"

Alcuin answered immediately. "Not responsible for what you we're never told."

"It still runs through me."

"So does choice."

The wind shifted, carrying old ash and damp stone smell through the ruined arch.

By dawn they agreed on next steps.

Collect evidence where possible.

Avoid final conclusions too early.

Find a living source in the nearby city who might know collapse records.

Keep tensions between them from becoming permanent fractures.

As they packed, Ksena looked once more at the shattered skyline.

She had arrived wanting one simple answer.

Humans did it.

Or elders did it.

Or enemies did it.

Instead she was leaving with something harder.

Layers.

Lies inside lies, stories built to hide older stories.

And somewhere inside those layers sat the truth she needed, whether she was ready for it or not.

Ksena rewrote their list three times before she was satisfied: what they knew, what they suspected, and what would kill them if they guessed wrong.

When Alcuin reviewed it, he crossed out two assumptions and replaced them with one instruction. "Confirm before acting." She nodded and folded the page into her jacket. They could survive fear. They could not survive building plans on the same lies that had already burned a village.
