It should be here.. It had to, this was the spot from the image, the ancient enemy was here, but was nothing ruins, the city had long been destroyed and forgotten, ruins covered the area, the city of the enemy is nothing but an abandoned ruin, and looks like it had been this way for thousands of year, how could this city long since destroyed be the threat to her city, if it’s destroyed why was the army sent out to defend them, it made little sense, this was nothing but rock houses covered in grass.
