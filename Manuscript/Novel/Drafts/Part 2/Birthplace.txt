This wasn't a village Ksena said as she surveyed the city below her, it was massive, larger than even her city, and this was from tribesman savages who only built mud huts, the city also bore some resemblance to her own home town, as if they had seen it and were trying to duplicate it, but despite the resemblance it was more rustic where her home town had massive gardens, the plants here were full of vegetables, there was also dotted animal pens around the town, horses and cattle, her own town had no animals, including pets, one reason Ksena had liked to visit the tribe outside.
How could this be? Ksena wondered, how could the savages have a town even bigger in size compared to her own.
