The barrier was gone.

Morning light reached the city without distortion for the first time in generations, exposing blackened towers, collapsed markets, and districts that looked suddenly older than memory.

Ksena stood on upper terrace, palms braced against cold stone, feeling the city breathe through shock.

Alcuin joined her and settled at her side.

"We won the fight," he said quietly. "Now we prove we can survive the peace."

Below them, crews moved through rubble while runners carried directives district to district. The old command structure had died with the crystal. What replaced it had to be built quickly and in public.

Kirk arrived with Estele before noon, both carrying departure manifests and unfinished handover reports.

"Human command is preparing outbound transmission," Kirk said. "Some crews are overdue to rotate home."

"Already?"

"Six years outbound," he said. "People are holding together, but home still matters."

Ksena looked at Estele.

"And you?"

Estele straightened.

"I requested envoy status. If approved, I travel as representative between your provisional council and Earth."

Ksena nodded.

"Then we build terms worth sending."

In a half-repaired hall that afternoon, they reviewed next-phase priorities: civilian stabilization, ritual-law reform, district deconfliction, and first-contact governance.

They also reviewed the first joint medical-science brief from ship researchers and local healers. Ascension was confirmed as both power transformation and biological divergence, with lifespan implications measured in centuries at minimum and potentially far longer. The room went quiet at that. Long life sounded like advantage until they listed the political risks: permanent office capture, slow-moving corruption, and leadership bottlenecks that could outlive dissent.

Grandmother wrote one new line into the draft charter on the spot: no position held beyond fixed term without recurring public reauthorization.

No one used the word victory.

When the meeting ended, Alcuin rubbed ash from his palms.

"After this," he said, "I need one month with no alarms, no councils, and no one trying to kill us."

Kirk laughed once.

"That sounds like a classified luxury package."

"I am serious."

"So am I."

By evening, launch operations were visible from western field. Human shuttles cycled cargo, medical stores, and archive copies. Kirk delayed departure one final day to complete communications handover and emergency relay discipline.

At launch perimeter, he clasped Alcuin's forearm and turned to Ksena.

"When we arrived, you asked for rescue," he said. "Now you are negotiating terms. Earth can work with that."

Ksena nodded.

"Then we build something worth negotiating with."

The shuttle lifted at dusk. Estele stood beside Kirk in envoy colors, hand to viewport as craft climbed.

Ksena watched until lights vanished into cloud.

Silence settled over the field.

Alcuin shifted closer.

"One day at a time?"

Ksena looked over the city.

"One honest day at a time."

At first light she began district rounds.

In each square she delivered the same message without softening it: the barrier had protected them, and it had imprisoned them under edited history. Some crowds met her with relief. Others with anger. A few turned their backs and walked away.

She let them.

Trust was not a decree.

At night she returned to maps, casualty tables, and reform drafts until her eyes blurred. Alcuin came back from outer corridors with road reports and witness lists. They stopped speaking about winning and started speaking about systems that could survive bad leaders.

Reconstruction moved faster than anyone expected and slower than Ksena needed.

Outer walls were patched in weeks. Water channels reopened by month two. Archive teams recovered enough pre-war records to challenge half the official history taught under crystal rule.

None of that repaired trust.

Village delegations still arrived armed. City families still crossed market lanes with old fear in their eyes. Former enforcers still woke unsure which memories were theirs and which had been imposed.

Grandmother chaired the transitional council with equal city and tribal seats and no patience for nostalgia.

"No forced ascension," she said in the first session. "No lineage quotas. No private command over ritual law."

The room erupted anyway.

By end of week one, they ratified four enforceable rules:

1. Ascension by informed consent only.
2. Civilian veto on military operations inside population zones.
3. Independent review board for ritual-training incidents.
4. Mandatory public logs for council decisions and emergency powers.

Alcuin handled what politics could not.

He led mixed crews rebuilding roads between settlements that had avoided each other for generations. First month brought fights, sabotage, and one near-collapse at flood-channel bridge works. Third month brought shared tool caches, shared watches, and fewer knives drawn over old insults.

Pragmatism moved faster than forgiveness.

Ksena took the hardest portfolio herself: reproductive manipulation files and hidden lineage policy.

With help from human researchers who stayed behind, her team mapped what elder regime had altered: birth-ratio controls, pairing restrictions, and access gates disguised as sacred tradition.

When records went public, two districts rioted and five demanded emergency reform votes.

Ksena opened hearings in archive square three days a week under full transcription.

Mothers spoke about children assigned by policy.

Sons spoke about ritual exclusion justified by bloodline myths.

Former officers spoke with shaking hands about orders they remembered giving and not choosing.

Above the hearing table, grandmother ordered one line carved in stone:

Accountability without vengeance.

Easy to engrave.

Hard to live.

Winter tested all of it.

Storms severed northern route. Grain convoys stalled. Illness spread through two lowland camps. Rumor channels blamed every faction at once.

Under old command, panic would have triggered crackdown.

Under new charter, they triggered transparent rationing, rotating escort corridors, and public daily briefings regardless of embarrassment.

The crisis hurt.

It held.

One evening after a fourteen-hour hearing cycle, Alcuin handed Ksena the marked draft of long-range charter.

"We still have gaps," he said.

"We always will," Ksena answered.

"Then why does this feel different?"

She looked over a city lit by routes that had been dead for centuries.

"Because before, power was a cage," she said. "Now it is responsibility that can be challenged."

He rested his head against hers.

Above them, human relay blinked in slow orbit, carrying delayed messages from Earth and reminders that wider galaxy would not wait for local healing.

Ksena folded the charter and set it between them.

"We are not finished rebuilding," she said.

Alcuin nodded.

"No. But we are building something worth inheriting."
