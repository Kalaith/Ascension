The barrier was gone.

Morning light reached the city without distortion for the first time in generations, exposing blackened towers, collapsed markets, and districts that looked suddenly older than memory. The ruins weren't romantic. They were ugly. Scars of a war that had almost killed them all.

Ksena stood on upper terrace, palms braced against cold stone, feeling the city breathe through shock.

Alcuin joined her and settled at her side. He looked different without his armor. Smaller, but more solid.

"We won the fight," he said quietly. "Now we prove we can survive the peace."

***

Below them, crews moved through rubble.

In the market square, a fight broke out. Two families arguing over a crate of reclaimed rations.

"It's ours!" a man shouted, brandishing a pipe.

"We need it more!" a woman yelled back.

Guards—former City Enforcers—moved to intervene, their hands drifting to their batons out of habit.

"Stop!"

Alcuin vaulted the barrier and landed in the square. He didn't use magic. He used his voice.

"Put the pipe down," he ordered.

"Who are you?" the man spat. "Another Architect?"

"No," Alcuin said. "I'm the guy who dug that crate out of the mud. And there are ten more behind it if you stop acting like children."

He opened the crate. Bread. Stale, but edible.

He broke a loaf in half and gave a piece to each of them.

"Eat," he said. "Then help us dig."

The tension broke. The guards lowered their weapons.

From the balcony, Ksena watched.

"He's good at that," Kirk said, appearing beside her.

"He's the foundation," Ksena agreed.

***

Kirk arrived with Estele before noon, both carrying departure manifests and unfinished handover reports.

"Human command is preparing outbound transmission," Kirk said. "Some crews are overdue to rotate home."

"Already?"

"Six years outbound," he said. "People are holding together, but home still matters."

Ksena looked at Estele.

"And you?"

Estele straightened.

"I requested envoy status. If approved, I travel as representative between your provisional council and Earth."

Ksena nodded.

"Then we build terms worth sending."

In a half-repaired hall that afternoon, they reviewed next-phase priorities.

Grandmother chaired the transitional council with equal city and tribal seats and no patience for nostalgia.

"No forced ascension," she said in the first session. "No lineage quotas. No private command over ritual law."

The room erupted.

"Without the lineage, the power will dilute!" a former priest argued.

"Good," Grandmother snapped. "Let it dilute. Let it flood the fields. Better a thousand small fires than one volcano."

By end of week one, they ratified four enforceable rules:

1. Ascension by informed consent only.
2. Civilian veto on military operations inside population zones.
3. Independent review board for ritual-training incidents.
4. Mandatory public logs for council decisions and emergency powers.

***

Then came the hearings.

Ksena opened hearings in archive square three days a week under full transcription.

It was painful.

Mothers spoke about children assigned by policy. Sons spoke about ritual exclusion justified by bloodline myths.

Former officers spoke with shaking hands about orders they remembered giving and not choosing.

One young guard stood up.

"I burned a village," he whispered. "Because the voice in my head said they were vermin. But I remember their faces."

The silence in the square was heavy.

"I remember their faces too," Ksena said softly. "You carry that. We all do. But you are here now. What will you build with those hands?"

The guard looked at his hands.

"I... I was a mason before the draft."

" Then build," Ksena said. "We need houses more than we need soldiers."

***

At launch perimeter, Kirk clasped Alcuin's forearm and turned to Ksena.

"When we arrived, you asked for rescue," he said. "Now you are negotiating terms. Earth can work with that."

Ksena nodded. "Tell them we are open for trade. But the door stays locked."

Kirk laughed. "Understood."

He turned to Estele. "Ready, Envoy?"

Estele took a deep breath. She hugged Ksena tight.

"I'll be back," she promised.

"I know," Ksena said. "Bring chocolate."

The shuttle lifted at dusk.

Ksena watched until lights vanished into cloud.

Silence settled over the field.

Alcuin shifted closer.

"One day at a time?"

Ksena looked over the city.

"One honest day at a time."

***

Winter tested all of it.

The storms hit early. Massive, freezing gales that swept down from the north, severing the supply route to the ridge clans. Grain convoys stalled in the drifts.

Illness followed the cold. 'Dust Lung', they called it—a respiratory infection caused by the ash of the war. It spread through the lowland camps like wildfire.

Hospitals were overwhelmed. There weren't enough healers.

"We're losing them," a medic told Ksena, his face gray with fatigue. "We need antibiotics. We need heat crystals."

But the crystals were scarce.

Rumors started. *The Council is hoarding the medicine. The City is keeping the warmth for itself.*

Under old command, panic would have triggered crackdown. Enforcers would have broken heads.

Under new charter, they triggered transparent rationing.

Ksena stood on a crate in the middle of the camp, freezing wind whipping her cloak.

"We have three days of coal left," she told the angry crowd. "We are splitting it. Half for the hospital. Half for the kitchens. The Council chambers go cold."

"Proven!" Alcuin shouted, dumping a bucket of coal onto the common pile. "I'm sleeping in a coat tonight."

The crowd murmured, but the anger deflated. If the leaders were freezing too, it was fair.

The crisis hurt.

It held.

One evening after a fourteen-hour hearing cycle, Alcuin handed Ksena the marked draft of long-range charter.

"We still have gaps," he said.

"We always will," Ksena answered.

"Then why does this feel different?"

She looked over a city lit by routes that had been dead for centuries.

"Because before, power was a cage," she said. "Now it is responsibility that can be challenged."

He rested his head against hers.

"We are not finished rebuilding," she said.

Alcuin nodded.

"No. But we are building something worth inheriting."
