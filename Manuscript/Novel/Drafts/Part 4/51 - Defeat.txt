They are here, Kalani screamed for job, and the fire around her body got brighter and brighter

Sister, we have to fight them together!

No, I will have all the glory, I will wipe these invaders from the sky, nothing will be left by ash, and everyone will know I am the strongest, the queen, Kalani laughed and shot up into the sky, growing brighter as she did

Everyone watches out. The attack she is doing I reckless!, please stop. You will destroy them and us.

Kalani just kept up laughing until she was as bright as the sun, crackling with energy

Take this, you bastards. After this, I will find your planet and nuke it from orbit!

Kalani threw the ball of pure flame at the enemy ships approaching

Everyone hid as Lanai maniacal screams continued out loud, the bang as the fireball hit the ships rocked the air, sending it screaming around them, the attack was reckless, Ksena had to use her own barrier to cover everyone to stop them from being blown away, if that attack had been leveled at her she doubted she would have been able to survive much less protect everyone, the explosion finally died down in the distance where the ships we're located was a bright cloud, her sister was still flying above, still laughing manically, but even from here Ksena could tell she was drained, it prob took all her remaining strength to stay in the air

Sister, come down, you have destroyed them now. Ksena took to fly up to her sister

No, it couldn’t be, she heard her sister say; she looked towards the clouds and the ships where coming towards them though the cloud, Ksena saw a flag from the flagship and screamed out to her sister, but she was too late, a bolt of light pierced through her sister’s body, who starting tumbling from the sky, Ksena rushed to grab her before she hit the ground, guiding her sister down to the ground, as soon as she pulled her hands back they we're covered in blood

Kalani spoke softly and cough blood as she did so, it can’t I'm the strongest. They are all destroyed..

Ksena knew this was fatal. The weapon has pieced her sister, leaving a gaping wound

You rest, we can finish the remaining ships

Kalani looks unfocused up into the sky. I'm sorry. She didn’t get any further before her hand when limp and her eyes rolled back.

Alcuin ran his hand over her eyes, shutting her eye lips while Ksena through her body over her sisters crying, the others stood around giving her space for grieving

I'm going to check to see what damage she did, Kirk said and took off without waiting. Estelle nodded and went with Kirk, training behind.

Alcuin knelt down beside Ksena, to let her know he was close. He also wanted to be close in case she acted rashly.

The enemy didn’t appear to take any damage from the attack, and Kalani put everything she had at it, and even if she hadn’t of been out of energy that beam still likely would have gone right thought her, how did their ancestors ever beat an enemy like this, and why are they choose now of all times to invade

Perhaps it was like the humans he had spoke to, they said the trip here actually took a long time, the people that came knew they wouldn’t be home anytime soon, perhaps these other enemies are even further away, and after being defeated, perhaps they spent some time as we'll preparing for it.

The device. Alcuin accidental said out loud, that device sent off a message, perhaps these aliens we're the ones that got the message.

Ksena sat up, her face was paler than usually. Had they caused these ships now appearing, what did that message contain in it?

She would need to fix this, these enemies where her responsibility, her sister was dead, her own city now laid unprotected because of her actions, had she doomed everyone in this pursuit, to save a sister that was now dead.

Kirk and Estele returned before sunset with ash across their boots and hard numbers in hand.

"Three capital ships damaged," Kirk said, dropping a cracked tablet onto the stone table. "Not destroyed. Defensive lattice absorbed most of the blast. They are regrouping outside upper range."

Ksena wiped her face and stood, forcing herself to release Kalani's body long enough to listen. Grief could wait one hour. Survival could not.

The strike had not won them anything except one lesson paid in blood: rage without coordination only strengthened the enemy's timing.

Alcuin covered Kalani with a cloak and joined the planning circle. "They used a precision beam," he said. "If they wanted total extermination, they would have fired into the city. They are selecting targets."

"Then we deny them clean targets," Ksena replied.

By nightfall they split the population into moving cells, opened emergency shelters beneath the inner district, and extinguished all non-essential lights. Grandmother coordinated shield modulation to scatter thermal signatures. Estele set up false beacon clusters in abandoned sectors to pull tracking fire away from civilians.

Kirk transmitted a priority burst to human command requesting immediate orbital analysis and countermeasure support. Reply time would be hours at best. They had to hold until then.

Before first watch ended, Ksena returned to Kalani's side. She touched her sister's brow and spoke quietly so only the dead could hear.

"I could not save you. I will not waste what you broke yourself trying to protect."

At dawn, enemy probes tested the outer perimeter and found a city that no longer moved like prey.

By second watch, the first probe strike hit the decoy district instead of the shelter grid. The blast tore open empty towers and lit the sky, but no civilians we're there to burn. Estele stood on the signal platform and watched the enemy adjust. "They are mapping response times," she said. "Next pass will be smarter."

"Then we stop behaving like a single target," Ksena answered.

They broke the city into nine autonomous defense cells, each with its own fallback route, medics, and signal chain. If one cell went dark, the rest would still function. Grandmother hated the fragmentation, but she admitted the old centralized model had died with the crystal.

Alcuin took command of the southern evacuation lanes, where the streets we're narrow and panic spread fastest. He moved in short bursts from block to block, lifting collapsed beams, calming families, and assigning runners who could carry instructions when comms failed. He looked more like a village hunter than an ascendant commander, and that was why people trusted him.

Near noon, Kirk received the first delayed packet from human command: partial spectral readouts from enemy hull plating, weak points in their defensive harmonics, and one warning highlighted three times. The beam weapon that killed Kalani required line lock and a short charging phase. If they disrupted lock during that window, the shot destabilized.

"We cannot outgun them," Kirk said, spreading the projection across a broken table. "But we can make precision impossible."

Ksena studied the data through red eyes that had not slept. "Smoke layers, heat scatter, moving decoys, and staggered launch signatures."

Estele nodded. "And no hero runs into open air."

For a moment, Kalani's last flight hung between them like a wound no one could touch.

They set the plan anyway.

By evening, the skyline looked like controlled chaos. Heat flares pulsed from abandoned rooftops. False ascent signatures rose and vanished in irregular patterns. Ground teams moved beneath insulated canopy cloth while mirror drones reflected phantom troop lines into enemy optics.

When the next beam charge began, Kirk called it out over encrypted channel. "Lock forming. Twelve seconds."

Ksena raised both hands and drove a rolling thermal surge across the eastern quarter. Alcuin triggered three decoys on delay. Estele dropped blackout screens between ridge towers.

The beam fired wide, carving a molten trench through empty stone outside the city walls.

People cheered from shelters before anyone could stop them. The sound was raw, half terror and half relief, but it carried. For the first time since Kalani fell, the city believed survival was possible.

That night, Ksena walked alone to the temporary memorial they had built for the dead near the old fountain court. Kalani's name had been etched first, not because she was a hero and not because she was innocent, but because she had been family and because grief did not need clean politics to be real.

Ksena knelt, touched the warm stone, and spoke into the dark.

"I am angry with you. I miss you anyway."

Behind her, footsteps approached and stopped. Alcuin did not interrupt. He just stood close enough that she could hear him breathing.

"Kirk says we can hold two more days before we run out of modulation crystals," he said at last.

"Then we make two days count."

She rose, wiped her face, and walked back toward command.

At 03:20, enemy transports attempted a low-altitude insertion over the northern rim. They expected panic. Instead they met cross-pattern fire from mixed teams who had trained together for less than a month and fought like they had trained for years. Two transports broke off. One crashed in the dry basin. The fourth escaped but dropped no troops.

By dawn, civilian casualty reports we're lower than worst-case projections for the first time since invasion. It was not victory. It was proof that deliberate defense could blunt superior force.

Kirk looked up from the casualty board and gave Ksena the only praise he ever trusted. "This is working."

Ksena stared at the map, then at the empty sky beyond the broken roofline.

"Good," she said. "Now we survive tomorrow."
