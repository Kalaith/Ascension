Kalani burned like a second sun above the city.

"They are here!" she screamed, voice breaking into laughter as flame poured off her skin in unstable arcs.

Ksena rose to meet her, one hand up in warning. "Kalani, stop. We fight together or we die separately."

"I do not share victories," Kalani said. "I erase enemies."

She climbed higher, drawing power so fast the air itself seemed to tear around her. Below, people dropped behind shattered walls. Even the veterans looked afraid.

"Kalani!" Ksena shouted again. "You are overloading."

Kalani answered by hurling a condensed sphere of white fire at the incoming fleet.

The blast shook the valley. Pressure rolled across rooftops and knocked people flat. Ksena threw up a barrier broad enough to shield the nearest streets, teeth clenched as heat hammered her guard.

For a heartbeat the sky was only light and noise.

Then the glare thinned.

Three enemy capitals were scorched but intact, defensive lattices rippling as they corrected formation.

Kalani hovered above the smoke, swaying.

"See?" she gasped. "Strongest."

A narrow beam lanced from the flagship and punched through her chest.

Ksena did not remember deciding to move. She was suddenly in the air, catching her sister before she hit stone. Blood soaked both arms instantly.

Kalani's eyes found hers for one clear second.

"I wanted... to be more than a weapon," she whispered.

Then her hand slackened.

Ksena lowered her to the ground and stayed there, bent over her, breathing in broken pulls.

Alcuin knelt beside her and closed Kalani's eyes with careful fingers.

Nobody spoke for several minutes.

Kirk and Estele returned from outer observation before sunset with hard data and no room left for denial.

"Three capitals damaged, none destroyed," Kirk said. "Their shield harmonics absorbed most of it. They are repositioning for precision passes."

Ksena wiped her face with the back of her wrist and stood.

"Then we stop giving them precision," she said.

That night they reorganized the city under active threat.

Grandmother split civilians into mobile shelter cells and opened old maintenance corridors as fallback routes. Alcuin took southern evacuation lanes and assigned runners for every block in case comms failed. Estele deployed false heat sources and decoy ascent signatures in abandoned districts. Kirk pushed encrypted requests to human command for orbital pattern analysis and beam-cycle timing.

By first watch, the city no longer behaved like a single target.

By second watch, the first probe strike hit a decoy quarter and destroyed empty towers.

"They're mapping response lag," Estele said from the signal platform.

"Then we feed them bad maps," Ksena answered.

They broke defense into independent cells with local authority and fixed retreat logic. If one cell went dark, the others kept operating.

At noon, delayed human telemetry arrived. Enemy beam weapons required short lock confirmation before discharge.

"If we disrupt line lock in that window, the shot drifts," Kirk said.

Ksena studied the timing block, then looked up.

"Smoke layers, thermal noise, moving decoys, staggered launch signatures," she said. "No static heroes. No clear center."

No one argued.

When the next beam cycle formed, Kirk called countdown over channel.

"Lock forming. Twelve seconds."

Ksena drove a thermal surge across the eastern quarter. Alcuin triggered three false signatures on delay. Estele dropped blackout screens between ridge towers.

The beam fired wide and carved a molten trench beyond the walls.

Cheering erupted from shelter corridors before command could quiet it. Fear was still there, but now it had something to stand on.

That night Ksena went alone to the memorial stones in the old fountain court. Kalani's name had been cut first.

Not because she had been innocent.

Because she had been family.

Ksena touched the carved letters with soot-stained fingers.

"I am angry with you," she said softly. "I miss you anyway."

Alcuin approached and stopped at her shoulder, saying nothing until she stood.

"Kirk says we can hold two more days before modulation stock runs out," he said.

"Then two days is enough," Ksena replied.

At 03:20, enemy transports attempted low insertion over the northern rim. They met crossfire from mixed teams that had trained together for weeks and fought like they had trained for years.

Two transports aborted. One crashed in the dry basin. The fourth escaped without deploying troops.

By dawn, casualty projections dropped below first-day worst-case for the first time since contact.

Kirk looked up from the board and gave Ksena the only praise he trusted.

"This is working."

Ksena watched the horizon through a broken roofline.

"Good," she said. "Now we survive tomorrow."
