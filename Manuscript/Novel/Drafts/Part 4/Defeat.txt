They are here, Kalani screamed for job, and the fire around her body got brighter and brighter
Sister, we have to fight them together!
No, I will have all the glory, I will wipe these invaders from the sky, nothing will be left by ash, and everyone will know I am the strongest, the queen, Kalani laughed and shot up into the sky, growing brighter as she did
Everyone watches out. The attack she is doing I reckless!, please stop. You will destroy them and us.
Kalani just kept up laughing until she was as bright as the sun, crackling with energy
Take this, you bastards. After this, I will find your planet and nuke it from orbit!
Kalani threw the ball of pure flame at the enemy ships approaching
Everyone hid as Lanai maniacal screams continued out loud, the bang as the fireball hit the ships rocked the air, sending it screaming around them, the attack was reckless, Ksena had to use her own barrier to cover everyone to stop them from being blown away, if that attack had been leveled at her she doubted she would have been able to survive much less protect everyone, the explosion finally died down in the distance where the ships were located was a bright cloud, her sister was still flying above, still laughing manically, but even from here Ksena could tell she was drained, it prob took all her remaining strength to stay in the air
Sister, come down, you have destroyed them now. Ksena took to fly up to her sister
No, it couldn’t be, she heard her sister say; she looked towards the clouds and the ships where coming towards them though the cloud, Ksena saw a flag from the flagship and screamed out to her sister, but she was too late, a bolt of light pierced through her sister’s body, who starting tumbling from the sky, Ksena rushed to grab her before she hit the ground, guiding her sister down to the ground, as soon as she pulled her hands back they were covered in blood
Kalani spoke softly and cough blood as she did so, it can’t I'm the strongest. They are all destroyed..
Ksena knew this was fatal. The weapon has pieced her sister, leaving a gaping wound
You rest, we can finish the remaining ships
Kalani looks unfocused up into the sky. I'm sorry. She didn’t get any further before her hand when limp and her eyes rolled back.
Alcuin ran his hand over her eyes, shutting her eye lips while Ksena through her body over her sisters crying, the others stood around giving her space for grieving
I'm going to check to see what damage she did, Kirk said and took off without waiting. Estelle nodded and went with Kirk, training behind.
Alcuin knelt down beside Ksena, to let her know he was close. He also wanted to be close in case she acted rashly.
The enemy didn’t appear to take any damage from the attack, and Kalani put everything she had at it, and even if she hadn’t of been out of energy that beam still likely would have gone right thought her, how did their ancestors ever beat an enemy like this, and why are they choose now of all times to invade
Perhaps it was like the humans he had spoke to, they said the trip here actually took a long time, the people that came knew they wouldn’t be home anytime soon, perhaps these other enemies are even further away, and after being defeated, perhaps they spent some time as well preparing for it.
The device. Alcuin accidental said out loud, that device sent off a message, perhaps these aliens were the ones that got the message.
Ksena sat up, her face was paler than usually. Had they caused these ships now appearing, what did that message contain in it?
She would need to fix this, these enemies where her responsibility, her sister was dead, her own city now laid unprotected because of her actions, had she doomed everyone in this pursuit, to save a sister that was now dead.

 At first they were surviving exile. Now they were shaping a response to systems that had lasted for generations. That required more than courage. It required evidence, timing, and enough allies to hold the line when retaliation came. Every conversation with locals, every recovered record, every successful withdrawal without losses moved them one step closer to that threshold. 

 They listed what was confirmed, what was likely, and what was still dangerous guesswork. Then they decided the next movement window and who carried what risk. That process kept arguments from expanding into paralysis. When tensions flared, they redirected to tasks: perimeter checks, route sketches, ration control, and fallback markers. It was not heroic, but it kept people alive. 

 Open ground meant speed but exposure. Broken ridges meant concealment but fatigue. Old roads meant faster travel but predictable ambush points. They adjusted route selection based on weather and patrol rhythm, not pride. If the safer line cost half a day, they paid it. If a village contact looked compromised, they cut communication and moved. Hard choices stopped feeling exceptional. They became the baseline rhythm of moving through contested territory.

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

 Missed signals, unclear hand marks, and assumptions about who had visual contact were all corrected. They standardized spacing by terrain type and set new no-call rules during high-risk crossings. Small improvements like that prevented cascading mistakes later. It was unglamorous work, but it turned chaos into repeatable movement, and repeatable movement meant survivability.

 Some wounds demanded action, but acting at the wrong time could destroy everything they had built. Ksena began stopping herself before rushing the most painful target. Alcuin stopped assuming delay was cowardice. Kirk stopped pushing for clean mission closure and started backing phased goals instead. The team did not become calm. They became deliberate, and that was better.

 Ksena still carried anger toward the city, Alcuin still carried doubt about what they were becoming, and Kirk still carried mission pressure from a world that expected clean answers. None of those burdens were solved in one night. But they started speaking about them before the next march, which prevented silent fractures later. In a campaign built on partial trust, honest discomfort was more useful than polite silence.

 They had enough proof to challenge old narratives, enough power to defend themselves in a limited fight, and enough scars to avoid easy traps. That was not victory. It was readiness. The next chapter would demand more from all of them, but they entered it with clearer roles and fewer fantasies.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.
