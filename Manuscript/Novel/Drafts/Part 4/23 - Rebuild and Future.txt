The barrier was gone.

Morning light reached the city without distortion for the first time in generations, exposing blackened towers, collapsed markets, and districts that looked suddenly older than memory.

Ksena stood on upper terrace with one hand over her abdomen, feeling the city breathe through shock.

Alcuin joined her and settled an arm at her waist.

"Do you think the child will be all right?" he asked.

"Yes," Ksena said. "We are different in appearance, not in worth. She will be ours, and she will have a choice."

Below them, crews moved through rubble while runners carried directives district to district. The old command structure had died with the crystal. What replaced it had to be built quickly and in public.

Kirk arrived with Estele before noon, both carrying departure manifests and unfinished handover reports.

"Human command is preparing outbound transmission," Kirk said. "Some crews are overdue to rotate home."

"Already?"

"Six years outbound," he said. "People are holding together, but home still matters."

Ksena looked at Estele.

"And you?"

Estele straightened.

"I requested envoy status. If approved, I travel as representative between your council and Earth."

Ksena smiled despite exhaustion.

"Then I cannot think of a better first envoy."

In a half-repaired hall that afternoon, they reviewed next-phase priorities: civilian stabilization, ritual law reform, district autonomy protocols, and first-contact governance.

They also reviewed the first joint medical-science brief from ship researchers and local healers. Ascension was confirmed as both power transformation and biological divergence, with lifespan implications measured in centuries at minimum and potentially far longer. The room went quiet at that. Long life sounded like advantage until they listed the political risks: permanent office capture, slow-moving corruption, and leadership bottlenecks that could outlive dissent.

Grandmother wrote one new line into the draft charter on the spot: no position held for life without recurring public reauthorization.

No one used the word victory.

When the meeting ended, Alcuin rubbed ash from his palms.

"After this," he said, "I need one month with no alarms, no councils, and no one trying to kill us."

Kirk laughed.

"That sounds like a classified luxury package."

"I am serious."

"So am I."

By evening, launch operations were visible from western field. Human shuttles cycled cargo, medical stores, and archive copies. Kirk delayed departure one final day to complete communications handover and emergency relay discipline.

At launch perimeter, he clasped Alcuin's forearm and turned to Ksena.

"When we arrived, you asked for rescue," he said. "Now you are negotiating terms. Earth can work with that."

Ksena nodded.

"Then we build something worth negotiating with."

The shuttle lifted at dusk. Estele stood beside Kirk in envoy colors, hand to viewport as craft climbed.

Ksena watched until lights vanished into cloud.

Silence settled over the field.

Alcuin shifted closer.

"One day at a time?"

Ksena looked over the city, then down at her hand over new life.

"One honest day at a time."

At first light she began district rounds.

In each square she delivered the same message without softening it: the barrier had protected them, and it had imprisoned them under edited history. Some crowds met her with relief. Others with anger. A few turned their backs and walked away.

She let them.

Trust was not a decree.

At night she returned to maps, casualty tables, and reform drafts until her eyes blurred. Alcuin came back from outer corridors with road reports and witness lists. They stopped speaking about winning and started speaking about systems that could survive bad leaders.

Sleep arrived in practical fragments.

Rebuilding had begun before ash settled.

Now it had terms.

Reconstruction moved faster than anyone expected and slower than Ksena needed.

Outer walls were patched in weeks. Water channels reopened by month two. Archive teams recovered enough pre-war records to challenge half the official history taught under crystal rule.

None of that repaired trust.

Village delegations still arrived armed. City families still crossed market lanes with old fear in their eyes. Former enforcers still woke unsure which memories were theirs and which had been imposed.

Grandmother chaired the transitional council with equal city and tribal seats and no patience for nostalgia.

"No forced ascension," she said in the first session. "No lineage quotas. No private command over ritual law."

The room erupted anyway.

By end of week one, they ratified four enforceable rules:

1. Ascension by informed consent only.
2. Civilian veto on military operations inside population zones.
3. Independent review board for ritual-training incidents.
4. Mandatory public logs for council decisions and emergency powers.

Alcuin handled what politics could not.

He led mixed crews rebuilding roads between settlements that had avoided each other for generations. First month brought fights, sabotage, and one near-collapse at flood-channel bridge works. Third month brought shared tool caches, shared watches, and fewer knives drawn over old insults.

Pragmatism moved faster than forgiveness.

Ksena took the hardest portfolio herself: reproductive manipulation files and hidden lineage policy.

With help from human researchers who stayed behind, her team mapped what elder regime had altered: birth-ratio controls, pairing restrictions, and access gates disguised as sacred tradition.

When records went public, two districts rioted and five demanded emergency reform votes.

Ksena opened hearings in archive square three days a week under full transcription.

Mothers spoke about children assigned by policy.

Sons spoke about ritual exclusion justified by bloodline myths.

Former officers spoke with shaking hands about orders they remembered giving and not choosing.

Above the hearing table, grandmother ordered one line carved in stone:

Accountability without vengeance.

Easy to engrave.

Hard to live.

Technology transfer became another fault line.

Irrigation pumps and sterilization kits were accepted quickly because they solved immediate pain. Advanced fabrication templates drew suspicion, especially in anti-ascendant districts that feared a new monopoly hidden inside foreign aid.

Ksena shifted from full-package rollout to modular pilots under local oversight.

Adoption improved as soon as control did.

Winter tested all of it.

Storms severed northern route. Grain convoys stalled. Illness spread through two lowland camps. Rumor channels blamed every faction at once.

Under old command, panic would have triggered crackdown.

Under new charter, they triggered transparent rationing, rotating escort corridors, and public daily briefings regardless of embarrassment.

The crisis hurt.

It held.

By spring, schools graduated their first mixed class under joint curriculum. Ceremony banners carried tribal patterns and old city script together. Students ignored seating charts, laughed too loudly, and turned rigid procession into something alive.

Ksena watched from back row with her daughter asleep against her shoulder and felt hope she did not fully trust yet.

That same week, anti-ascendant mayor who had rejected her three times finally accepted a visit.

Ksena did not open with ideology. She opened with metrics: clinic outcomes, crop recovery, violence rates, audit logs, and transport reliability.

They signed one narrow agreement.

Shared water management.

Neutral medical access.

It was small.

It mattered.

At home, stakes looked different but no less real.

Night feedings. Interrupted sleep. Katesh demanding attention at impossible hours. Alcuin pretending he could function on three hours of rest. Grandmother correcting all of them with imperial certainty and occasional quiet pride.

One evening, after the baby finally slept, Alcuin handed Ksena the marked draft of long-range charter.

"We still have gaps," he said.

"We always will," Ksena answered.

"Then why does this feel different?"

She looked over a city lit by routes that had been dead for centuries.

"Because before, power was a cage," she said. "Now it is responsibility that can be challenged."

He rested his head against hers.

Above them, human relay blinked in slow orbit, carrying delayed messages from Earth and reminders that wider galaxy would not wait for local healing.

Ksena folded the charter and set it between them.

"We are not finished rebuilding," she said.

Alcuin nodded.

"No. But we are building something worth inheriting."

Ktira hated school.

Not because she could not do the work.

Because she could not sit still while daylight was wasting outside.

Classroom windows faced scrub hills and old hunting trails. She watched dust move over ridge while instructor filled board with war dates that ended before she was born.

Her leg bounced under desk.

If her parents let her choose, she would spend morning tracking hornback through dry ravines with Katesh at her side.

Instead she copied treaty clauses.

When final bell sounded, she was out the door before half the class packed.

She hit home at a run, changed into hunting gear, and reached for her pack.

"Ktira," her mother called from downstairs in the tone that meant no debate. "Before you vanish, take Katesh. He needs range time."

Ktira leaned over rail.

"That is not a chore. That is a reward."

Her mother gave her a look that said she was not fooled.

"Back before dinner."

"Yes, Mom."

Katesh padded beside her through scrubline, tail flicking sparks that died in dry grass. Air smelled like stone and rain that might arrive tomorrow.

They picked up hornback sign near broken culvert and followed it north.

Halfway to ridge, Katesh froze and growled low.

Ktira dropped to one knee and listened.

Voices.

Not hunters.

Patrol cadence.

She crawled to ridge lip and looked down into service road. Three city officials argued with two village wardens over training quotas, school attendance, and controlled ascension modules.

Even out here, school found her.

"If you want children to stay," one warden said, "teach what keeps them alive before next crisis."

The official answered, "If we want no return to crystal rule, they learn history as well as combat."

Ktira rolled onto her back, annoyed and unwillingly thoughtful.

She wanted hunts, not lectures.

But she had watched enough adults fail to know ignorance had a body count.

Katesh nudged her shoulder.

"Fine," she whispered. "We hunt now. We argue with teachers tomorrow."

They took hornback clean before dark.

At home, her father inspected cuts with obvious pride and hid it behind criticism about blade angle. Her mother checked for strain injuries while pretending not to smile.

Ktira ate fast and ignored council logistics at table.

Next morning she almost pretended to be sick.

Almost.

At breakfast, her father slid folded schedule across table.

"Pass this term and I sign you for advanced tracking with ranger corps."

Ktira narrowed her eyes.

"That is bribery."

"That is parenting," he said.

Her mother added, "Grades drop, field clearance freezes. We are not negotiating this every week."

School felt different after that.

In civic law they compared new charter to old crystal edicts and marked where power had hidden behind sacred language. In history they analyzed conflicting battle accounts and justified which sources they trusted.

Ktira raised her hand before she could stop herself.

"None are complete," she said. "Writers always want something."

Instructor nodded once.

"Good. Start there."

At training block they rotated through map reading, signal discipline, trauma response, and controlled ascent drills under strict output caps. City-born students were cleaner on formal sequence. Tribal students were faster under pressure. By week three they were stealing each other's techniques instead of mocking each other's origins.

Ktira still complained.

But less.

Rin caught her on south wall after class.

"So, school still useless?"

Ktira watched cargo lifts moving stone and grain through rebuilt lanes.

"Sitting still is useless," she said. "Learning is useful."

"Most Ktira answer possible," Rin said.

Two days later, Ktira got first supervised ranger assignment: missing livestock near old canal sectors. Observe and report only. No hero choices.

She moved with three trainees through wet reeds, reading prints and ash traces the way Alcuin taught her.

They found thieves by dusk.

Not raiders.

Displaced families from anti-ascendant quarter whose supply line had collapsed.

Hungry, armed, and one bad encounter away from becoming enemy faction.

Ktira wanted to step out and solve it fast.

Training overruled instinct.

She signaled withdraw, logged coordinates, and called mediation support.

By nightfall, wardens and aid couriers reached camp with ration transfers and relocation terms.

No bloodshed.

No revenge spiral.

On walk back, Rin glanced sideways.

"Old Ktira would have charged in."

"Old Ktira was reckless," Ktira said.

"New Ktira?"

She looked toward city lights and rebuilt towers.

"Still reckless," she said. "Just better aimed."

That night rain tapped roof tile while Ktira finished homework before anyone asked. She took Katesh outside and sat under awning, watching her mother on upper terrace finishing late meeting with teachers, wardens, and two village delegates.

They argued, rewrote terms, argued again, then signed.

No one looked happy.

Everyone looked committed.

Ktira scratched Katesh behind ears and watched signatures dry.

"Maybe this is hunting too," she murmured.

Not chasing prey through brush.

Tracking consequences before they turn into war.

Tomorrow she would still complain about school. She would still run for wilds whenever she could.

But she understood now why her parents refused to let her choose only one kind of strength.

The future needed both.
