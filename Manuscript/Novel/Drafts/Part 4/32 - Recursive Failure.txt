The signal was not a hero. It was a distraction.

A small, high-pitched mechanical shriek echoed from the ventilation shaft above.

Her father paused.

For a man who had planned wars for centuries, a rogue sound in his sanctuary was an impossibility. It broke his concentration.

Just for a heartbeat.

The pressure on Ksena's ribs vanished.

She dropped to the floor, coughing, but Katesh was already moving. The small construct—part metal, part scavenged servos—leaped from the vent, latching onto her father's shoulder with hydraulic claws.

"Pest," her father sneered, reaching up to tear the machine off.

Katesh exploded.

Not a large explosion. Just enough to stagger him. Just enough to fill the air with smoke and confusion.

Ksena didn't charge. She ran for the pedestal.

The crystal housing hummed in the center of the room. It was the brain of the city. The source of his control.

"Don't touch it!" her father roared, flinging the remains of Katesh aside.

He raised both hands, summoning a wave of pure force designed to vaporize her where she stood.

Ksena reached the pedestal.

**The Override**

She didn't try to shield herself. She didn't try to attack him.

She grabbed the crystal housing with both hands. It burned.

It was pure order. Cold. Mathematical. It expected a command code.

Ksena didn't give it a code.

She gave it a scream.

Not a sound. A feeling.

She opened the floodgates of her own mind. She poured everything she had held back—the grief for Kalani, the horror of the burning city, the years of repression, the raw, messy, illogical pain of being human.

She didn't hack the system. She poisoned it.

"Process this!" she screamed into the matrix.

The crystal pulsed. Violent. Erratic.

*Input error: Logic undefined. Emotional variance detected.*

The wave of force her father had summoned didn't dissipate. It curved. The system couldn't verify the target anymore because the system was having a panic attack.

It hit him.

Her father staggered back, his own power slamming into his chest.

"Impossible," he gasped. "The lattice is perfect."

"Perfection can't bleed!" Ksena shouted. Her hands were charring against the housing, but she didn't let go. She shoved more grief into the light. "It can't mourn! It can't feel!"

The feedback loop intensified. The crystal began to crack. It wasn't designed for this frequency. It was designed for silence. It was choking on the noise of a human soul.

High-pitched frequencies shattered the glass cases along the walls. The air itself began to ionize, turning purple.

Her father fell to his knees. The light in the room shifted from white to a violent crimson.

"I built this world for you," he whispered, looking up at her with eyes that were finally, genuinely afraid. "Without me, it is chaos."

"No," Ksena said, stepping back as the floor began to buckle. "You built a cage. And I'm opening the door."

The crystal shattered.

The explosion wasn't fire. It was sound. A localized sonic boom that ripped the top off the Ritual Tower.

The dome above them disintegrated.

Masonry, glass, and steel rained down.

Her father was gone—consumed by the release of centuries of stored energy.

**The Collapse**

The floor tilted forty-five degrees.

Ksena slid, grabbing a broken pillar to stop herself from sliding into the abyss where the core had been.

The tower was dying. It wasn't just falling; it was unmaking itself. The walls were dissolving into dust. The stairs were crumbling.

"Move!" she told herself.

She scrambled up the tilted floor to the balcony door. It was jammed.

She blasted it with a kinetic pulse. It flew off into the night.

The balcony was gone. Just a few twisted girders hanging over nothing.

Below, the city was a map of fire.

"I can't jump this," she realized.

Then she heard the hum.

Dropships. Not enemy. Theirs.

A battered transport hovered into view, searchlights sweeping the ruin.

"Ksena!" Alcuin's voice, amplified.

"I'm here!"

The ship couldn't get close. The turbulence was too high.

"Jump!" Alcuin yelled, leaning out of the open hatch, his hand extended.

It was ten meters. A death sentence.

Ksena looked back at the dissolving room.

She took a breath. And she jumped.

For a second, she was flying. Weightless.

Then Alcuin's hand caught her wrist.

The jolt nearly dislocated her shoulder. He grunted, slamming against the hatch frame, but he didn't let go.

"Gotcha," he gasped.

He hauled her in.

They hit the deck plating as the pilot punched the throttle. The ship banked hard, peeling away just as the top third of the Ritual Tower collapsed inward.

They watched through the rear reinforced glass.

The spire fell. It crashed into the courtyard, burying the gardens, the statues, and the past.

A cloud of white dust rose to cover the moon.

**Silence**

The ship was silent.

Alcuin sat on the floor, breathing hard. The other soldiers—survivors from the street war—stared at Ksena with wide eyes.

She was covered in blood, ash, and crystal dust. She looked less like a commander and more like a wraith.

"Is it done?" a young corporal asked.

Ksena looked at the cloud of dust.

"Yes," she said. "It's done."

She leaned back against the bulkhead and closed her eyes.

The noise of the battle below had stopped.

Even the Ancestral ships seemed to hesitate.

Then, slowly, the silence was broken.

Not by gunfire.

By voices.

Thousands of them. Rising from the streets. Confused, terrified, but free.

The compulsion was broken.

Ksena closed her eyes. Her body screamed in pain. Her heart felt hollowed out.

But she was alive.

And for the first time in her life, the sky above her belonged to no one.
