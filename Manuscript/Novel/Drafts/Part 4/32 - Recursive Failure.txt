The signal was not a hero. It was a distraction.

A small, high-pitched mechanical shriek echoed from the ventilation shaft above.

Her father paused.

For a man who had planned wars for centuries, a rogue sound in his sanctuary was an impossibility. It broke his concentration.

Just for a heartbeat.

The pressure on Ksena's ribs vanished.

She dropped to the floor, coughing, but Katesh was already moving. The small construct—part metal, part scavenged servos—leaped from the vent, latching onto her father's shoulder with hydraulic claws.

"Pest," her father sneered, reaching up to tear the machine off.

Katesh exploded.

Not a large explosion. Just enough to stagger him. Just enough to fill the air with smoke and confusion.

Ksena didn't charge. She ran for the pedestal.

The crystal housing hummed in the center of the room. It was the brain of the city. The source of his control.

"Don't touch it!" her father roared, flinging the remains of Katesh aside.

He raised both hands, summoning a wave of pure force designed to vaporize her where she stood.

Ksena reached the pedestal.

She didn't try to shield herself. She didn't try to attack him.

She grabbed the crystal housing with both hands and *pushed*.

Not with force. With recursion.

She fed his own command signal back into the loop.

"Access command: Override," she screamed into the matrix. "Subject: Architect. Paradox: True."

The crystal pulsed. Once. Twice.

The wave of force her father had summoned didn't dissipate. It curved. It wrapped around the room, following the path of least resistance—the command signature itself.

It hit him.

Her father staggered back, his own power slamming into his chest.

"Impossible," he gasped. "The lattice is perfect."

"Perfection has no redundancy!" Ksena shouted over the rising whine of the overload. "You built a system that only listens to you! So I made it scream at you!"

The feedback loop intensified. The crystal began to crack.

Her father fell to his knees. The light in the room shifted from white to a violent crimson.

"I built this world for you," he whispered, looking up at her with eyes that were finally, genuinely afraid.

"No," Ksena said, stepping back as the floor began to buckle. "You built a cage. And I'm opening the door."

The crystal shattered.

The explosion wasn't fire. It was sound. A localized sonic boom that ripped the top off the Ritual Tower.

The dome above them disintegrated.

Masonry, glass, and steel rained down.

Her father was gone—consumed by the release of centuries of stored energy.

Ksena was thrown clear, landing hard on the balcony outside.

She lay there for a long time, staring up at the smoke-filled sky.

The noise of the battle below had stopped.

Even the Ancestral ships seemed to hesitate.

Then, slowly, the silence was broken.

Not by gunfire.

By voices.

Thousands of them. Rising from the streets. Confused, terrified, but free.

The compulsion was broken.

Ksena closed her eyes. Her body screamed in pain. Her heart felt hollowed out.

But she was alive.

And for the first time in her life, the sky above her belonged to no one.
