The retreat was ugly.

Standard doctrine said you fell back in waves. One unit covered, one unit moved. Repeat.

Reality said you fell back while things exploded around you and people screamed.

Ksena sprinted down the Merchant's Avenue, her boots slipping on wet cobblestones—slick with rain, oil, and blood. Around her, the motley resistance force—guards who had defected, market workers with scavenged pistols, teenagers with improvised explosives—scrambled for cover.

"Left flank is collapsing!" Alcuin shouted over the roar of a collapsing building.

A heavy walker stepped through the storefront of a bakery Ksena had visited a hundred times. The smell of burning flour mixed with ozone. The walker leveled its pulse cannon at a group of civilians huddled behind a delivery cart.

"No," Ksena snarled.

She didn't have the firepower to penetrate its armor. But she knew the city.

"Alcuin! Support pillars!"

Alcuin didn't question her. He fired a high-explosive round into the base of the overhang above the walker.

The stone facade of the Merchant's Guild groaned and sheared off. Tons of marble crashed down onto the machine, burying it in a cloud of dust and sparks.

The walker thrashed, its legs pinned, but the cannon kept firing blindly, chewing up the street.

"Move! Everyone move!" Ksena waved the civilians toward the alleyways. "Into the sewers! Use the maintenance hatches!"

This was her city. Her father had designed the grand avenues for parades and surveillance. But she had mapped the cracks. The forgotten spaces.

They dove into a narrow service alley just as a squad of Ancestrals marched into the main square. The violet beams swept the area, disintegrating the rubble where they had been seconds before.

In the dark of the tunnel, children were crying.

Ksena leaned against the damp brickwork, catching her breath. Her side burned where a piece of shrapnel had grazed her ribs.

"How many?" she asked a medic who was bandaging a guard's arm.

"Lost contact with Fourth Squad," the medic said bleakly. "And the refugees from the East Gate... they didn't make it to the tunnel in time."

Ksena closed her eyes for a second. The image of the walker crushing the bakery played in loop.

"We can't hold the Middle City," Alcuin said quietly. "They're just grinding us down. Every block we hold costs us ten people."

"If we run to the inner sanctum now, we trap ourselves," Ksena said. "We need to bleed them here. Make them afraid to enter the narrow streets."

"They aren't afraid," Alcuin countered. "They're machines. Or close enough."

"Everything breaks," Ksena said. "Even them."

She checked her weapon charge. "We hold the bridge at the canal. It’s a choke point. If we can bottle them up there, we buy the civilians time to get to the Deep Shelter."

"The bridge is suicide," Alcuin said.

"The bridge is necessary."

They moved out again.

The canal district was worse. The water was boiling from thermal lance strikes. Steam choked the air.

They set the ambush.

When the Ancestral column advanced onto the bridge, Ksena didn't wait for them to cross. She waited until the heavy armor was in the center.

"Blow it," she ordered.

The charges under the arch detonated.

The bridge buckled. For a moment, it held, defying gravity. Then, with a prolonged screech of tearing metal and stone, it collapsed into the boiling water below.

The Ancestral squad went with it.

For a moment, there was cheering.

Then the sky darkened.

Three dropships descended over the canal, hovering like vultures. They didn't land troops. They opened fire on the buildings lining the water.

The world turned white.

Ksena was thrown back into a storefront, glass shattering over her armor. She looked up, dazed, to see the apartment block opposite simply dissolve.

Not collapse. Dissolve.

Matter turned to dust in seconds.

"Fall back!" she screamed, her ears ringing. "Forget the Middle City! Fall back to the Inner Gate!"

They ran.

There was no strategy now. Only survival.

Behind them, the Middle City burned. The places Ksena had learned to walk, learned to steal, learned to fight—all of it was being erased.

Her father would have called this necessary pruning.

She called it murder.

She scrambled over a barricade and fell onto the pristine white pavement of the Inner District entrance.

The gates slammed shut behind the last of her ragged stragglers.

"Seal it," Ksena ordered, her voice cracking.

The heavy blast doors groaned and locked.

Silence fell, heavy and suffocating.

They were safe for a moment. But they were trapped.

"Two districts gone," Alcuin said, sliding down the wall to sit beside her. "In four hours."

"We still have the core," Ksena said, though she didn't believe it. "We still have the Palace."

"And your father," Alcuin added.

Ksena looked up at the looming tower of the Ritual Hall.

"Yes," she said. "And my father."
