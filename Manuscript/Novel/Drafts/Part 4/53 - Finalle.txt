The barrier was gone.

Morning light fell into the city without distortion for the first time in generations, exposing blackened towers, collapsed markets, and whole districts that looked older than they had the day before.

Ksena stood at the upper terrace with one hand over her abdomen, feeling the city breathe through shock.

Alcuin joined her and rested his arm around her waist.

"Do you think the child will be all right?" he asked quietly. "With everything we've been through."

Ksena leaned into him. "Yes. We are different in appearance, not in worth. She will be ours, and she will have a choice."

Below them, emergency crews moved through rubble while runners carried new directives district to district. The old command structure had collapsed with the crystal lattice. What replaced it had to be built quickly and in public.

Kirk arrived with Estele before noon, both of them carrying departure manifests and unfinished reports.

"Human command is preparing outbound transmission," Kirk said. "Some crews are overdue to rotate home."

"Already?" Ksena asked.

"Six years outbound," he said. "People are holding together, but home matters."

Ksena looked at Estele. "And you?"

Estele straightened, suddenly formal. "I requested envoy status. If approved, I travel as a representative between your council and Earth."

Ksena smiled despite the fatigue in her bones. "Then I cannot think of a better first envoy."

Later, in a half-repaired briefing hall, the four of them reviewed next-phase priorities: civilian stabilization, ritual law reform, district autonomy protocols, and first-contact governance with external powers.

No one used the word victory.

When they finished, Alcuin sat back and rubbed ash from his palms.

"After this," he said, "I need a month with no alarms, no councils, and no people trying to kill us."

Kirk laughed. "That sounds like a classified luxury package."

"I am serious," Alcuin said.

"So am I," Kirk replied.

By evening, launch preparations were visible from the western field. Human shuttles cycled cargo, med kits, and archive copies for transfer. Kirk delayed departure one final day to complete handover of communications encryption and emergency relay discipline.

At the launch perimeter, he clasped Alcuin's forearm, then turned to Ksena.

"When we arrived, you were asking for rescue," he said. "Now you are negotiating terms. Earth can work with that."

Ksena nodded. "Then we build something worth negotiating with."

The shuttle lifted at dusk. Estele stood beside Kirk in envoy colors, one hand pressed to the viewport as the craft climbed.

Ksena watched until the lights disappeared into cloud.

Silence settled around the field.

Alcuin shifted closer. "One day at a time?"

Ksena looked over the city, then down at her hand still resting over new life.

"One honest day at a time," she said.

At first light the next morning, she began district rounds.

In each square she delivered the same message without softening it: the barrier had protected them from invasion, and it had imprisoned them under edited history. Some crowds met her with relief. Others with anger. A few turned their backs and walked away.

She let them.

Trust was not a decree.

At night she returned to council maps, casualty tables, and reform drafts until her eyes blurred. Alcuin returned from outer corridors with road reports and witness lists. They stopped speaking about winning and started speaking about systems that could survive bad leaders.

When sleep finally took them, it came in short, practical fragments.

Rebuilding had begun before ash settled.

Now it had terms.
