The barrier was now down, and sunlight shone down on the war ravished city, Ksena felt her heart ache at seeing it like this, it had been necessary but so much lost and for people like the elders, her sister wanting power, now there gone, while the towns inhabitants would still be open to tampering everyone that was doing that dampening now lies dead.

Eventually they would find a way to clear that control over them and let the true history of Xeron come to past, perhaps joining the humans in space who had fought alongside them, Ksena glanced at Kirk, him and Steel still seemed like a strange combo Ksena giggled they would both have a very interesting life, moving her hand down over her stomach, Ksena could feel the new life within herself, Alcuin wrapped his around her, one going over her on her stomach

Do you think there will be any issue with out child, I wasn’t like you, Ksena blushed and cut him off, its fine we are the same even if our appearance was different

Alcuin nodded and hugged the both of them tightly

Most of the city inhabitants don't know whats happened, I should start visiting them and explaining, perhaps if they saw me they might be willing to talk first, we want to avoid any unnecessary engagements, Kirk have the humans pulled back? Kirk nodded Yes, they are preparing to leave soon and give the good news back to earth.

Already Ksena asked, it is a long trip back and allot of the guys are homesick

Are you planning on staying? Ksena asked with a glance at Estele, I am I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys, I will be back, moving his hand around Estele waist and pulling her close, Estele has already spoken to the general about visiting earth as a spokesperson for your people, if that's alright

Ksena smiled at the news while Estele blushed, that's more fine I wouldn’t trust anyone else to be out first real contact

What plans do you have going forward after this, Kirk asked Ksena and Alcuin

A long holiday I think Alcuin replied, we have been on the road for over a year, I want to spend some time back with my tribe, although they barely recognize me now.

Kirk chucked at that, Alcuin appreance did change rather drastically and lucky it did

Ksena nodded along with it, I'll be spending some time with my family as we'll and helping the city recover, I think allot of things will be changing, we are still discussing about the ascension ritual, it will be hard to consider ourself as one race for quite awhile on both sides, we expect that even when people are offered the chance to ascend they will hold out, so this is going to take a bit of work, one day I would like if we all ascended, not because of the power but as our natural path of evolution

The rebuilding began before the ash had settled.

Ksena spent the next weeks walking district by district with elders, healers, and translators at her side, telling the same hard truth in every square: the barrier had protected them, but it had also imprisoned them under a history edited for obedience. Some crowds met her with relief. Others with silence. A few with open anger. She accepted all of it.

Alcuin took teams into the outer settlements to reopen roads and escort families back through cleared corridors. He came home each night with dust to his knees and a new list of names needing food, medicine, and witness statements. They stopped thinking in terms of victory and started thinking in terms of systems.

Kirk delayed his departure twice to finish handover protocols with the city council and train a mixed communications unit drawn from both factions. When his shuttle finally lifted, Estele stood beside him in formal envoy robes, not as a token but as a negotiator with authority.

At the edge of the launch field, Kirk clasped Alcuin’s forearm, then looked at Ksena. "You are not asking for rescue anymore," he said. "You are asking for partnership. Earth can work with that."

After the shuttle vanished, Ksena rested a hand over her stomach and watched the sky clear. The child she carried would inherit a world still bruised, still divided, and still dangerous. But it would also inherit a world where the truth was no longer buried.

"One day at a time," Alcuin said quietly, standing beside her.

She nodded. "One honest day at a time."
