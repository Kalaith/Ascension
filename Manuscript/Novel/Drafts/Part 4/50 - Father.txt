Ksena's father had spent centuries preparing for a second invasion.

What he had not prepared for was dissent from his own blood.

He paced the command hall while reports stacked faster than aides could sort them. Disturbances at the barrier. Missing ritual artifacts. Uncontrolled ascendant signatures in outer districts. Human interference escalating from observation to active support.

He did not see complexity. He saw betrayal.

When the elders assembled, he stood beneath the war map and spoke without pause.

"The containment era is over," he said. "We move to full suppression."

No one challenged him. Some could not. Others no longer remembered how.

"Primary strike group engages the human vessel and denies aerial support. Secondary units clear resistance cells in tribal corridors. Internal command teams secure ritual assets and detain defectors."

He turned to the final row where Ksena's mother stood rigid, eyes fixed forward, jaw tight.

"You hold the access route to my residence," he said. "No one enters. No exceptions."

"Yes," she answered, voice flat.

He dismissed the council and watched them move as one body. Efficient. Obedient. Hollow.

Outside, sirens rose.

Human distraction fire hit the northern shield arc, not enough to breach, enough to force response. He smiled without warmth.

"Predictable," he said.

What he did not see was the second movement beneath his own command layer.

In the east quarter, grandmother rallied freed contacts and began evacuation corridors through maintenance tunnels the old regime had sealed from public maps. In the lower terraces, Alcuin coordinated mixed teams to clear civilians before major clashes reached residential blocks.

At the inner gate, Ksena arrived with grandmother and ran straight into the one obstacle she had feared most.

Her mother.

The first fireball came fast and low.

Ksena flinched. Grandmother snapped a shield up and split the attack across two stone pillars.

"Focus," grandmother barked. "She is bound."

Ksena stared at her mother, at the controlled precision in every stance, at the tiny tremor in her left hand that looked almost like resistance.

"I don't want to fight her," Ksena said.

"Then you fight for her," grandmother said. "Go."

Ksena hesitated one heartbeat too long. Her mother launched again. This time Ksena moved, rolling past the strike and forcing distance.

Grandmother stepped into the lane and engaged, flame against flame, old discipline against old conditioning.

"Finish this," grandmother said through clenched teeth.

Ksena looked once at her mother.

For a fraction of a second, her mother met her eyes and smiled, small and broken, as if passing permission through a crack in the control.

Ksena turned and flew toward the ritual district.

Behind her, the city fractured into simultaneous battles.

Controlled veterans held formal lines around strategic nodes.

Newly freed ascendants fought in irregular clusters, uncertain but determined.

Human support teams stayed to evacuation and suppression protocols, pulling civilians from collapse zones while avoiding direct command of local fighters.

Alcuin held the east corridor long enough to move the last family convoy through a service cut.

He glanced toward the ritual tower as light began to pulse from within.

"Come back," he said under his breath.

In the tower antechamber, Ksena paused with one hand on the scorched doorframe.

Rage pressed against her ribs like a second pulse.

She let it pass through.

If she entered angry, she would die angry.

She entered steady.

Beyond the threshold, her father's power rolled through the chamber in deliberate waves, shaping heat gradients, narrowing movement lanes, turning architecture into a weaponized arena.

He had expected her.

Good, Ksena thought.

So had she.
