**Memory Index: Year 12. Subject: Kalani.**

It was raining ash even then. A small industrial fire in sector 7 had painted the sky grey.

Usef stood by the window, watching the smoke. He was six years old.

"It looks like a monster," he whispered.

"It looks like inefficiency," Kalani said. She was eight. She was sitting at the immaculate white table, arranging her logic crystals by hue. "If the fire suppression grid had redundant sensors, the smoke would have been contained in twelve seconds."

"But it's pretty," Usef argued. "The way it moves."

Kalani stopped organizing. She looked at the smoke.

"Chaos isn't pretty, Usef. It's a mistake. It means someone failed."

She looked down at her crystals. Perfect lines. Perfect order.

"I won't fail," she promised. "I will be the fire that burns the smoke away."

**Present Day**

The inner gate held for now, but the sky above did not.

The Ancestral fleet had lowered its orbit. The massive hulls blocked out the remaining daylight, casting the ritual district into perpetual twilight.

From the bridge of the flagship *Vanguard*, General Hale watched the tactical feed.

"Local defenses are heavy," her adjutant reported. "That shield dome is denser than anything our scanners showed. And... we're tracking a new thermal signature. Rising from the central spire."

Hale tapped the console.

"Is it a weapon?"

"It's... biologic, ma'am. But reading like a reactor."

"Identify."

"Target lock unavailable. It's moving too fast."

"All batteries, defensive screen," Hale ordered. "Don't fire until we have a clean target. We're here to rescue, not orbital bombard."

"Sir, reading a massive thermal spike in sector one."

"Define massive."

"Stellar."

Xylos looked at the main screen.

The second sun rose.

It ascended from the Ritual Tower balcony, a burning sphere of white-hot plasma that defied gravity and reason.

"Kalani," Ksena breathed, watching the streak of light tear upward.

Through the comms, static screamed. "Target lock acquired! Multiple signatures converging on sector 1!"

Kalani wasn't fighting like a soldier. She was fighting like a natural disaster.

She hovered above the shattered dome of the library, wreathed in flame so intense the air rippled around her. She wasn't human anymore. She was a silhouette of light, a star trapped in the shape of a girl.

The first wave of Coalition fighters—sleek, interceptors meant for precision strikes—broke formation to evade her.

"Unidentified entity," a pilot broadcast on open hailing frequencies. "Stand down. We are not hostile."

Kalani didn't dodge.

She laughed.

"You are intruders," she projected, her voice shaking the glass in the windows below. "You are dirt."

She threw her arms out.

A ring of fire expanded from her body. It wasn't just heat; it was concussive force. It hit the drone squadron and disintegrated them. Metal turned to vapor.

"She's burning the atmosphere," Alcuin shouted, shielding his eyes. "The oxygen levels are dropping!"

***

Ksena sprinted toward the tower base.

"Get me a line to her!" she shouted into her wrist unit. "Kalani! Stop! They're allies!"

"They are insects," Kalani's voice came back, distorted by power. It sounded like fire crackling. "I am the sun."

"You're attacking the rescue fleet!" Ksena yelled. "Listen to me! They are here to help us!"

"Help?" Kalani laughed. It was a sound entirely devoid of joy. "Father was right about one thing, little sister. The universe is a garden of predators. You don't invite them in. You burn them out."

A Coalition cruiser banked hard, trying to avoid her path. Its defense turrets spun up, firing warning shots.

"Kalani, move!"

Kalani didn't move. She expanded.

She grabbed the targeting array of the library's defense turret—a relic weapon deactivated for centuries—and fused her own nervous system into the firing port.

"External power source accepted," the automated voice droned.

"Targeting solution," Kalani grit out. "The flagship. Burn it."

She fired.

The beam wasn't violet or white. It was raw, dirty thermal energy. It hit the anti-matter slug ten meters from the barrel.

The explosion wasn't a flower. It was a hammer.

The cruiser's shield collapsed. The hull buckled, glowing white-hot as the beam carved a trench through its midsection. It didn't fall, but it listed heavily, venting atmosphere.

The Coalition fleet paused.

Then every gun turned toward the glowing speck of the girl.

On the bridge of the *Vanguard*, General Hale stepped back from the screen.

"She's a WMD," Hale said grimly. "We can't let her near the engines. All batteries. Fire for effect. Eliminate the hostile."

***

Cheers rose from the defenders on the ramparts—they thought she was winning. They didn't understand who she was killing.

But Ksena saw the cost. And the horror.

Kalani fell twenty meters before correcting her flight. Her light dimmed.

"She's burnt out," Alcuin said, lowering his binoculars. "Her bio-signs are spiking. If she channels again..."

"I'm going up there," Ksena said. "Cover me."

"You can't fly," Alcuin reminded her.

"I can climb."

Ksena scrambled up the maintenance ladder of the nearest watchtower. The heat was suffocating even here. The metal rungs burned her gloves.

Above, the enemy fleet adjusted tactics. They stopped firing at the city and turned every gun on the glowing speck in the center of the airspace.

"Kalani!" Ksena screamed from the tower roof. "Take my hand! We can ground the charge! Together!"

Kalani turned. For a second, the fire cleared from her face. She looked exhausted. She looked young.

"I can't stop," she whispered. Her hands were fused to the generator housing now. "They're still in the sky, Ksena. I won't let them land."

"They are humans! They are friends!"

"They are arrogant," Kalani coughed, sparks flying from her mouth. "The shield generator... if I reverse the polarity... if I feed it everything... it becomes a localized EMP. It will strip their shields. It will drop them out of the sky."

"It will kill you," Ksena realized. "And it will kill thousands of them."

"Good," Kalani said.

She looked at the flagship descending above them.

"Get to the bunker, sister. I'm clearing the board."

"Kalani, no!"

"Go!" Kalani roared, and the heat flared so bright Ksena was thrown back to the ladder.

Ksena slid down, burning her hands, hitting the ground running. She didn't look back.

Above her, Kalani closed her eyes. She stopped fighting the fire. She let it in. She became the circuit.

She pushed her own resonance into the generator, overriding the safety limits.

*Warning: Critical Mass.*

"Burn," Kalani whispered.

The shield dome didn't break. It inverted.

There was no sound at first. Just a blinding white silence that erased the world.

Then the shockwave hit.

The flagship's shields shattered. The vessel groaned, systems shorting out across the board. It listed, engines dying, drifting dead in the water. Smaller escort ships spiralled away, dark.

She hadn't destroyed them. But she had blinded them.

And the light in the sky vanished.

A small, charred figure fell from the smoke.

Ksena was running before she hit the ground. She caught Kalani just above the pavement, her own momentum slamming them both into the stone.

"Kalani?"

Her sister’s skin was ash-grey. Her armor was fused to her flesh. But her eyes were open.

"Did I... stop them?" Kalani wheezed.

Ksena looked up. The human ships were crippled, drifting, fires burning on their decks. They weren't destroyed, but they weren't landing *troops* either.

"Yes," Ksena wept, holding her sister who had just saved a dictator's city from its liberators. "You stopped them."

"Good," Kalani whispered. "Tell Father... tell him I was useful."

"You were more than useful," Ksena sobbed. "You were brilliant."

Kalani closed her eyes.

"Brilliant," she breathed.

The chest stopped moving.

Ksena roared. A sound of grief and fury that echoed off the cold walls of the Palace.

Around them, the battle paused. The human ships burned in the distance. The defenders—Father's loyalists—lowered their weapons in respect.

But the sky remained full of crippled ships.

And the war wasn't over. Ksena had just lost her sister to a lie.

Ksena laid her sister gently on the stone. She stood up. Her hands were shaking, not with fear, but with a cold, crystallizing hate.

"Alcuin," she said into the comms. Her voice was unrecognizable.

"I'm here."

"Open the Inner Gate. We're not defending anymore."

"What are we doing?"

"We're finishing this."
