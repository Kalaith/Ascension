The inner gate held for now, but the sky above did not.

The Ancestral fleet had lowered its orbit. The massive hulls blocked out the remaining daylight, casting the ritual district into perpetual twilight.

Then the second sun rose.

It ascended from the Ritual Tower balcony, a burning sphere of white-hot plasma that defied gravity and reason.

"Kalani," Ksena breathed, watching the streak of light tear upward.

Through the comms, static screamed. "Target lock acquired! Multiple signatures converging on sector 1!"

Kalani wasn't fighting like a soldier. She was fighting like a natural disaster.

She hovered above the shattered dome of the library, wreathed in flame so intense the air rippled around her. She was throwing bolts of pure energy at the passing fighters, swatting them out of the sky with terrifying ease.

But she was burning.

Ksena could see it even from the ground—the way the light flickered, the way her sister’s form seemed to blur at the edges. She was drawing too much power from the core.

"Get me a line to her!" Ksena shouted into her wrist unit. "Kalani! Pull back! You're overloading!"

"They are insects," Kalani's voice came back, distorted by power. "I am the sun."

"You're dying!" Ksena yelled. "Listen to me! We have the shields! You don't need to hold the sky alone!"

"Someone has to," Kalani laughed. It was a sound entirely devoid of joy. "Father won't. Mother can't. It's just us, little sister. Just the failures."

A heavy cruiser descended through the clouds, its main cannons charging.

"Kalani, move!"

Kalani didn't move. She expanded.

She threw her arms wide, and a shockwave of thermal energy erupted from her chest. It hit the cruiser's shields and shattered them. The ship listed, burning, and crashed into the outer wall.

Cheers rose from the defenders on the ramparts.

But Ksena saw the cost.

Kalani fell twenty meters before correcting her flight. Her light dimmed.

"She's burnt out," Alcuin said, lowering his binoculars. "Her bio-signs are spiking. If she channels again..."

"I'm going up there," Ksena said. "Cover me."

"You can't fly," Alcuin reminded her.

"I can climb."

Ksena scrambled up the maintenance ladder of the nearest watchtower. The heat was suffocating even here.

Above, the enemy fleet adjusted tactics. They stopped firing at the city and turned every gun on the glowing speck in the center of the airspace.

"Kalani!" Ksena screamed from the tower roof. "Take my hand! We can ground the charge! Together!"

Kalani turned. For a second, the fire cleared from her face. She looked exhausted. She looked young.

"I can't stop," she whispered. The audio pickup barely caught it. "If I stop, they win."

"If you don't stop, I lose a sister!"

The flagship overhead opened its primary aperture. A beam of violet light, thick as a building, began to coalesce.

Kalani looked up at it. She smiled. A sad, tired smile.

"I was always better at burning things than building them," she said.

She launched herself straight at the flagship.

"No!" Ksena reached out, but her fingers grasped only hot air.

Kalani collided with the beam just as it fired.

There was no sound at first. Just a blinding white silence that erased the world.

Then the shockwave hit.

The flagship's cannon exploded backward, gutting the vessel. It broke in two, raining burning debris over the outer districts.

But the light in the sky vanished.

A small, charred figure fell from the smoke.

Ksena was running before she hit the ground. She caught Kalani just above the pavement, her own momentum slamming them both into the stone.

"Kalani?"

Her sister’s skin was ash-grey. Her armor was fused to her flesh. But her eyes were open.

"Did I... get them?" Kalani wheezed.

"Yes," Ksena wept, holding her tight. "You got them. You saved us."

"Good," Kalani whispered. "Tell Father... tell him I was useful."

Her eyes drifted shut. The chest stopped moving.

Ksena roared. A sound of grief and fury that echoed off the cold walls of the Palace.

Around them, the battle paused. The enemy ship burned in the distance. The defenders lowered their weapons in respect.

But the sky remained full of ships.

And the war wasn't over.

Ksena laid her sister gently on the stone. She stood up. Her hands were shaking, not with fear, but with a cold, crystallizing hate.

"Alcuin," she said into the comms. Her voice was unrecognizable.

"I'm here."

"Open the Inner Gate. We're not defending anymore."

"What are we doing?"

"We're finishing this."
