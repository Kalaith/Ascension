Ktira was bored, school was so boring, it all day every day, she just wanted to go on the wilds and hunt, but her mother and father both insisted that she go to school, why me she thought glumly, plenty of the tribe children didn’t go to school, they would spend the way sharpening their weapon or doing something else to prepare themselves, and Ktira was here watching a board fill up as the teacher went on and on over old wars that happened in the past, the last war was just before she was born and the world had been peaceful since, as Ktira had grown up more and more former hunter children had come to the city, so Ktira wasn’t the only one that felt held up here, it wasn’t fair that her parents both made these decisions for her.
If she could practice her hunting, she would be the best hunter around, she prob already was, but the other tribes kids got allot more prep and practice, often with their family as well, her mother didn’t know a thing about hunting, but her father was a pro, if Ktira was the expert young hunter, she father was the best experienced older hunter, he had given her plenty of lessons, but only if she stuck to her schoolwork, he never did it as a child and yet he was forcing his own flesh and blood too despite knowing how much she was enjoying hunting
Time couldn’t go quickly enough, after this was lessons on ascending, but Ktira didn’t think she needed it, she was already close to being ascended she could already summon flames, most of the other students couldn’t, some thought therefore she was such a good hunter, but Ktira didn’t use her powers while hunting, although she did sometimes wish her mother would teach her how to fly, father couldn’t, but if father was a pro hunter, mother was the best at using her ascendant powers, the other thing was mothers pet, Katesh the flame cat, Ktira would give away anything to have one by her side, the flame cat even made her father look like a idiot out hunting, it has a natural beauty to it, designed entirely for hunting and killing, the powers likely helped, it would have been the fastest creature on the planet, and when it got ascended powers by bonding and could use them to help it move even faster but it was extremely rare, her mothers was the only known one in existence, even the older elders didn’t speak about them, Ktira sighed hanging her head she watched the clock as it slowly moved, not even her daydreaming could help make the time move any faster.

When it was finally over, Ktira felt all the lethargy leave her, she was done with class and now it was time to hunt, Ktira might have even cheated a little getting home, she couldn’t fly but making her movements quicker wasn’t out of her power, reaching home she quickly threw off her uniform and got dressed in her hunting gear, it was finally time
Ktira, could you come down and help before rushing off, her mother asked. Ktira threw up her hands in disgust. She wasn’t fast. Enough, yes, mom coming down.
Ktira mom was beautiful, Ktira had defiantly been lucky to get most of her mothers good looks, with just enough of her fathers, that left no doubt who’s child she was, her mom didn’t enjoy hunting and was scared Ktira might hurt herself, her mother was just a worrywart, it’s funny to think she had anything to do with the war, Ktira imagined her mother led a very sheltered life, she enjoyed the home life, the only thing that seemed to make her more outgoing was her interest in the ascension powers, they had built up a lot of respect for her, and her mother and father were practically honey on each other, it sometimes made her sick, two people shouldn’t be in love that much
Yes mom, Ktira asked respectively. She loved her mom and her mother knew how much she wanted to hunt. This wouldn’t take long.
Can you please take Katesh with you when you go hunting? He needs some outside time and I really haven’t gotten enough lately for him, his looking a bit dim.
Ktira nodded. Even if she would be looked down on for bringing the fire cat to hunting, she would have even more people writhing in agony, to make it worth it.
Let's go Katesh, maybe you with me we can hunt some really large prey, be careful, her mother admonished her
Yes mom, I will ill be back before dinner

 At first they were surviving exile. Now they were shaping a response to systems that had lasted for generations. That required more than courage. It required evidence, timing, and enough allies to hold the line when retaliation came. Every conversation with locals, every recovered record, every successful withdrawal without losses moved them one step closer to that threshold. 

 Open ground meant speed but exposure. Broken ridges meant concealment but fatigue. Old roads meant faster travel but predictable ambush points. They adjusted route selection based on weather and patrol rhythm, not pride. If the safer line cost half a day, they paid it. If a village contact looked compromised, they cut communication and moved. Hard choices stopped feeling exceptional. They became the baseline rhythm of moving through contested territory.

 They had enough proof to challenge old narratives, enough power to defend themselves in a limited fight, and enough scars to avoid easy traps. That was not victory. It was readiness. The next chapter would demand more from all of them, but they entered it with clearer roles and fewer fantasies. 

 They listed what was confirmed, what was likely, and what was still dangerous guesswork. Then they decided the next movement window and who carried what risk. That process kept arguments from expanding into paralysis. When tensions flared, they redirected to tasks: perimeter checks, route sketches, ration control, and fallback markers. It was not heroic, but it kept people alive. 

 Some wounds demanded action, but acting at the wrong time could destroy everything they had built. Ksena began stopping herself before rushing the most painful target. Alcuin stopped assuming delay was cowardice. Kirk stopped pushing for clean mission closure and started backing phased goals instead. The team did not become calm. They became deliberate, and that was better.

 Ksena stopped counting fear as weakness and started counting it as data. If a ridge stayed quiet too long, it meant movement somewhere else. If patrol noise vanished, it meant someone was waiting instead of searching. Alcuin tracked those changes with hunter patience, and Kirk marked them in his field notes. By dawn they had fewer illusions, but better odds. 

 Missed signals, unclear hand marks, and assumptions about who had visual contact were all corrected. They standardized spacing by terrain type and set new no-call rules during high-risk crossings. Small improvements like that prevented cascading mistakes later. It was unglamorous work, but it turned chaos into repeatable movement, and repeatable movement meant survivability.

 Ksena still carried anger toward the city, Alcuin still carried doubt about what they were becoming, and Kirk still carried mission pressure from a world that expected clean answers. None of those burdens were solved in one night. But they started speaking about them before the next march, which prevented silent fractures later. In a campaign built on partial trust, honest discomfort was more useful than polite silence.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.

By first light they were already moving through stone shadows. The wind carried dust and the smell of old ash from somewhere west, enough to remind them how quickly a settlement could vanish. Ksena felt the weight of every village they had crossed, every face that looked at her with hope or fear and asked her to choose who she would become next. She kept walking anyway. Stopping would not protect anyone.
