The Ritual Chamber was exactly as she remembered it: perfectly symmetrical, terrifyingly sterile, and humming with absolute power.

Her father stood in the center, hands clasped behind his back, looking out through the transparent dome at the burning city below. He didn't turn when she entered. He didn't acknowledge the blood on her face, or the scorch marks on her armor.

"You arrived late," he said calmly.

"I had to walk through the ruins you made," Ksena said. Her voice was raspy with smoke.

He turned slowly. His face was unlined, unbothered. He looked like a man concluding a tedious business negotiation.

"Ruins are temporary," he said. "Order is eternal. We will rebuild. Better. Cleaner."

"There is no 'we'," Ksena spat. "Kalani is dead. Mother is fighting grandmother in the courtyard. Your order killed your family."

"My family failed my order," he corrected gently. "And now you have come to fail it one last time."

He raised a hand.

Ksena didn't even see the attack coming.

She was simply... relocated.

One moment she was standing by the door. The next, she was slammed into the far wall, her breath driven from her lungs by an invisible hammer.

She slid to the floor, gasping.

"You think this is a fight," her father said, walking toward her. "It is not. It is corrections."

He gestured again.

Fire erupted from the floor tiles beneath her. Ksena rolled, her cloak singeing, and scrambled to her feet. She threw a desperate shield up as he followed with a wave of kinetic force. It shattered her defense like glass and threw her backward again.

"Your technique is flawed," he observed. "Too much emotion. Too much waste."

"Emotion kept me alive!" Ksena shouted, launching a bolt of lightning from her palm.

He caught it. Caught the lightning in his bare hand and crushed it into sparks.

"Emotion is inefficiency," he said. "It is why you cry. It is why you hesitate. It is why you lose."

He closed the distance, his steps echoing in the vast silence of the chamber.

Ksena fought. She threw everything she had—fire, ice, force, the tricks she had learned in the gutters, the forbidden knowledge she had stolen from the archives.

He countered every move with minimal effort. A tilt of his head to dodge a fireball. A flick of his wrist to dissolve a stone wall.

He was the Architect. He knew the building blocks of reality better than she knew her own name.

He pinned her against a pillar with a gesture, suspending her in the air.

"Look at you," he said, not unkindly. "Broken. Bleeding. Alone. Was your rebellion worth this?"

Ksena spat blood onto the pristine floor.

"I'm not alone," she wheezed.

He frowned slightly. "Your allies are dying in the streets. Your sister is ash. Your mother is broken. Who is left?"

"Hope," Ksena whispered.

He sighed. "Childish."

He began to squeeze. The pressure on her ribs increased until she heard bones creak.

"I will remake you," he promised. "I will scour the chaos from your mind and leave only perfection. You will be beautiful again."

The world darkened at the edges of Ksena's vision.

Perfection.

Silence.

Obedience.

It would be so easy to let go.

But then, a small sound cut through the ringing in her ears. A chirrup. Mechanical but alive.

Katesh.

Her father didn't hear it. He was too focused on his masterpiece.

Ksena managed a small, bloody smile.

"Perfection... is boring," she gasped.

And she gave the signal.
