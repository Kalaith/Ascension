Ksena entered the ritual chamber. She could feel her father’s presence. Kalani was a child. Her father had over a thousand years’ experience, including a war, and he had imprisoned her grandmother.

Father, please stop this, Ksena pleaded

Child, you do not understand. The war took everything from. This, it was only because we got this power that we could beat them. Back; we need to be prepared for them

It’s been over a thousand years and the hasn’t returned

That’s what she said. She wanted to ignore the threat they posed. If you are going to side with her, I will stop and imprison you and all your followers, include those invaders that have come from another planet in that ship.

They are only helping us

That’s what they all say but we can only rely on our power to hold the enemy back her father circled around the room, Ksena kept a close eye on him, he had her beat in every way, but the only way to save people would be o fight them

I don’t want to fight yo father. If you let everyone choose, we can stop this now

No, different opioun weaken us, we fight between ourselves and allow a spot for the enemy to come in

I have travelled with others that differ from me. Our differences didn’t make us weaker. We could cover for each other, I wouldn’t be here now without them.

Child silence, my view will not be changed. You will accept it or you will be imprisoned for all time after watching me destroy all your friends, including the humans.

Her father threw a fireball at her, Ksena pulled up a shield of flame, but his attack twisted it and had enough strength to knock her back, he didn’t give her a break, throwing blow after blow at her, knocking her into a wall and hitting her hard, if her own protection was not enough she would have been crushed against the wall

Ksena matched to throw a fireball back at her father, enough to give her a moment to catch her brief, but it wasn’t long before he pulled in closer and attacked her, Ksena fought back and dodged his attacks and deflected them enough to avoid damage, her father was showing no signs of slowly down and the room was getting destroyed with the ferocity of his attacks, small chips from the building where getting past her defences and she was soon bleeding from many small wounds

After a large attack, she was knocked down to the ground

Submit and serve me or I will kill you and your rebellion now

No, I will not kill me, I will not let you win

Her father summoned a ball of flame and compressed it and spun it faster and faster, feeing more energy into it. If you do not submit, this attack will kill you.

Do it kill me

Ksena knew she wouldn’t be able to block it, just as he was about to launch it Ksena clenches her eyes close, she would die here, there was a roar and Katesh launched himself at her father, it wasn’t something he expected as its jaws bit into his arm holding the attack, her father lost control of the attack as he wrestled with the cat, eventually he could fling it at the wall, Ksena could hear bones break as Katash slammed into the wall, Ksena pulled out as much strength as she could and threw it at her father, the blows didn’t even phase him as her attacks hit, they we're not enough, her father dismissed them with a dismissive gesture

If you will not submit, this is the end, using his other hand her father started amass power into it and walking towards her, Ksena pulled herself up to the pillar, Katesh was not moving in the corner and she was about to die at her fathers hand, as she brought his fist to punch her, Ksena grabbed the crystal from the pillar and used that to block her fathers attack

As the father’s attack hit the crystal, the crystal absorbed his powers and applied its control over him. As the one that set the original spell, feedback crackled between him and the crystal, he fell back as the crystal glowed hotter and hotter; it was trying to give him control over himself and the loop was reaching a peak. Her father glowed brighter. Eventually she couldn’t even look at him. She threw herself over the body of Katesh.

Her father was screaming. The screamers grew louder and louder until the explosion hit Ksena was showered in rubble and the crystal glowing hot with power literally sunk into the ground; the ground fusing over the top of it; it wasn’t until Ksena was found by Alcuin; he looked little better than her. He had been fighting multiple enemies, stopping them from entering.

What happened

My father is dead. I used the crystal to block his attack, and it pulled his powers from him, trying to force him to submit until he exploded. Katesh.

Ksena knelt down beside Katesh, pulling his head onto her lap. His breathing was shallow, but he was still breathing. Ksena hugged him gently. At least she hadn’t lost him.

What happened to the rest?

After the explosion, most of them feel unconscious, and the rest don’t seem to pose any threat at the moment, let's head towards your grandmother, I'll pickup Katesh for you

Ksena nodded as Alcuin picked up Katesh Ksena started heading through the rubble, outside the room the city did not look like how she remembered much of it was blackened with flame, she had brought this to her city, most of the inhabitants that Alcuin had been fighting where huddled together and crying, between the loss of the shield and their leader controlling their actions, they looked towards Ksena and Alcuin carrying Katesh but made no movement towards them

Ksena stumbled along. The battle with her father had used all her power. She looked as powerless as when she first left the city. Ksena doubted she could even light a fire right now.

Her heart leaped into her throat as she saw her mother and grandmother hugging. They looked very similar ascendant, seem to stop aging once they reached full maturity.

Ksena used what little strength she had to run the final distance and collapse into her grandmother and mother’s embrace.

I am so sorry Ksena her grandmother said

His dead grandmother I killed him

It’s okay, you did what you had to do

Her mother pulled her into a tight hug. It’s okay. I understand what happened. I am worried I was powerless to do anything about it.

The crystals buried, it took all his power and melted into the ground

It’s better this way. We didn’t need the barrier, not now.

Ksena hugged her mother and grandmother tightly

The corridor alarms fell silent one by one as the control lattice collapsed with her father's death.

Grandmother steadied herself against a shattered arch and looked toward the buried crystal chamber. "The binding network is gone," she said. "Those under compulsion will recover, but slowly."

Outside, the battle dissolved into confusion rather than victory. Ascendants who had obeyed for decades stood in smoke and rubble, suddenly unsure whose orders we're real and whose memories we're their own. Some wept. Some dropped weapons and stared at their hands.

Ksena stayed with Katesh while healers worked over him. Two ribs broken, one lung bruised, heavy internal strain, but alive. When his eyes finally opened, dim but aware, she bent her forehead to his and let herself breathe for the first time since entering the chamber.

By midnight, emergency councils formed in three districts. No one trusted a single authority anymore, and that was exactly why they might survive this transition.

At first light, Ksena stood in the ruined central square with her mother on one side and grandmother on the other. She addressed survivors, fighters, and civilians together.

"The old command is over," she said. "No one will be bound by crystal law again. We rebuild with consent, or we do not rebuild at all."

No one cheered. The city was too exhausted for triumph. But people listened, and that was enough to begin.

When the crowd dispersed, Alcuin joined her at the edge of the square, ash still streaked across his face. "You ended him," he said quietly.

Ksena looked at the broken skyline and nodded once. "Now we prove that ending him meant something."

She did not sleep that night. She sat in the archive hall while scribes cataloged the first recovered records, signing emergency decrees with shaking hands and refusing every suggestion to delay hard decisions until grief passed.

If they waited, someone else would fill the vacuum with the same old violence under a new name.

By dawn she had signed the final order and sealed it with the new council mark: no single ascendant, including herself, would ever hold unilateral command over ritual law again.
