Ktira hated school.

Not because she could not do the work. Because she could not sit still while daylight was wasting outside.

The classroom windows looked toward scrub hills and old hunting trails. She watched dust move over the ridge while the instructor filled a board with dates from wars that had ended before she was born.

Her leg bounced under the desk.

If her parents had let her choose, she would have spent the morning tracking hornback through dry ravines with Katesh at her side.

Instead she copied treaty clauses.

When final bell sounded, she was out the door before half the class had packed.

She hit home at a run, changed into hunting gear, and reached for her pack.

"Ktira," her mother called from downstairs, voice calm in the way that meant no argument. "Before you vanish, take Katesh. He needs range time."

Ktira leaned over the rail. "That is not a chore. That is a reward."

Her mother gave her a look that said she was not fooled.

"Back before dinner."

"Yes, Mom."

Katesh padded beside her through scrubline, tail flicking sparks that died in dry grass. The air smelled like stone and rain that might arrive tomorrow.

They picked up hornback sign near a broken culvert and followed it north.

Halfway to the ridge, Katesh froze and gave a low growl.

Ktira dropped to one knee and listened.

Voices. Not hunters. Patrol cadence.

She crawled to the lip and looked down into the service road below. Three city officials were arguing with two village wardens over training quotas, school attendance, and controlled ascension modules.

Even out here, school found her.

"If you want children to stay," one warden said, "teach what keeps them alive before the next crisis."

The official answered, "If we want no return to crystal rule, they learn history as well as combat."

Ktira rolled onto her back and stared at the sky, annoyed and unwillingly thoughtful.

She wanted hunts, not lectures.

But she had watched enough adults fail to know ignorance had a body count.

Katesh nudged her shoulder.

"Fine," she whispered. "We hunt now. We argue with teachers tomorrow."

They took the hornback clean before dark.

At home, her father inspected the cuts with obvious pride and tried to hide it behind criticism about blade angle. Her mother pretended not to smile while checking for strain injuries.

Ktira ate fast and listened to them debate council logistics she barely cared about.

The next morning she almost pretended to be sick.

Almost.

At breakfast, her father slid a folded schedule across the table.

"Pass this term," he said, "and I sign you for advanced tracking with ranger corps."

Ktira narrowed her eyes. "That is bribery."

"That is parenting," he said.

Her mother added, "Grades drop, field clearance freezes. We are not negotiating that every week."

School felt different after that.

In civic law they compared the new charter to old crystal edicts and marked where power had hidden behind sacred language. In history they analyzed conflicting battle accounts and had to justify which sources they trusted.

Ktira raised her hand before thinking.

"None are complete," she said. "Writers always want something."

The instructor nodded once. "Good. Start there."

At training block they rotated through map reading, signal discipline, trauma response, and controlled ascent drills with strict output caps. City-born students were cleaner on formal sequence. Tribal students were faster under pressure. By week three, they were stealing each other's techniques instead of insulting each other's backgrounds.

Ktira still complained.

But less.

Rin caught her on the south wall after class and bumped her shoulder.

"So. School still useless?"

Ktira watched cargo lifts move stone and grain through rebuilt lanes.

"Sitting still is useless," she said. "Learning is useful."

"That is the most Ktira answer possible," Rin said.

Two days later, Ktira got her first supervised ranger assignment: missing livestock near old canal sectors. Observe and report only. No hero decisions.

She moved with three trainees through wet reeds, reading prints and ash traces the way Alcuin had taught her.

They found the thieves by dusk.

Not raiders.

Displaced families from an anti-ascendant quarter whose supply line had collapsed.

Hungry, armed, and one bad encounter away from becoming an enemy faction.

Ktira wanted to step out and solve it the fast way.

Training overruled instinct.

She signaled withdraw, logged coordinates, and sent for mediation support.

By nightfall, wardens and aid couriers reached the camp with ration transfers and relocation terms. No bloodshed. No revenge spiral.

On the walk back, Rin glanced sideways at her.

"Old Ktira would have charged in."

"Old Ktira was reckless," Ktira said.

"New Ktira?"

Ktira looked toward city lights and rebuilt towers.

"Still reckless," she said. "Just better aimed."

That night rain tapped roof tile while Ktira finished homework before anyone asked. She took Katesh outside and sat under the awning, watching her mother on the upper terrace finishing a late meeting with teachers, wardens, and two village delegates.

They argued, rewrote terms, argued again, then signed.

No one looked happy.

Everyone looked committed.

Ktira scratched Katesh behind the ears and watched the signatures dry.

"Maybe this is hunting too," she murmured.

Not chasing prey through brush.

Tracking consequences before they turned into war.

Tomorrow she would still complain about school. She would still run for the wilds whenever she could.

But she understood now why her parents had refused to let her choose only one kind of strength.

The future needed both.
