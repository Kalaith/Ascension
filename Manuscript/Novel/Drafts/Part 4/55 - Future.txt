Ktira was bored, school was so boring, it all day every day, she just wanted to go on the wilds and hunt, but her mother and father both insisted that she go to school, why me she thought glumly, plenty of the tribe children didn’t go to school, they would spend the way sharpening their weapon or doing something else to prepare themselves, and Ktira was here watching a board fill up as the teacher went on and on over old wars that happened in the past, the last war was just before she was born and the world had been peaceful since, as Ktira had grown up more and more former hunter children had come to the city, so Ktira wasn’t the only one that felt held up here, it wasn’t fair that her parents both made these decisions for her.

If she could practice her hunting, she would be the best hunter around, she prob already was, but the other tribes kids got allot more prep and practice, often with their family as we'll, her mother didn’t know a thing about hunting, but her father was a pro, if Ktira was the expert young hunter, she father was the best experienced older hunter, he had given her plenty of lessons, but only if she stuck to her schoolwork, he never did it as a child and yet he was forcing his own flesh and blood too despite knowing how much she was enjoying hunting

Time couldn’t go quickly enough, after this was lessons on ascending, but Ktira didn’t think she needed it, she was already close to being ascended she could already summon flames, most of the other students couldn’t, some thought therefore she was such a good hunter, but Ktira didn’t use her powers while hunting, although she did sometimes wish her mother would teach her how to fly, father couldn’t, but if father was a pro hunter, mother was the best at using her ascendant powers, the other thing was mothers pet, Katesh the flame cat, Ktira would give away anything to have one by her side, the flame cat even made her father look like a idiot out hunting, it has a natural beauty to it, designed entirely for hunting and killing, the powers likely helped, it would have been the fastest creature on the planet, and when it got ascended powers by bonding and could use them to help it move even faster but it was extremely rare, her mothers was the only known one in existence, even the older elders didn’t speak about them, Ktira sighed hanging her head she watched the clock as it slowly moved, not even her daydreaming could help make the time move any faster.

When it was finally over, Ktira felt all the lethargy leave her, she was done with class and now it was time to hunt, Ktira might have even cheated a little getting home, she couldn’t fly but making her movements quicker wasn’t out of her power, reaching home she quickly threw off her uniform and got dressed in her hunting gear, it was finally time

Ktira, could you come down and help before rushing off, her mother asked. Ktira threw up her hands in disgust. She wasn’t fast. Enough, yes, mom coming down.

Ktira mom was beautiful, Ktira had defiantly been lucky to get most of her mothers good looks, with just enough of her fathers, that left no doubt who’s child she was, her mom didn’t enjoy hunting and was scared Ktira might hurt herself, her mother was just a worrywart, it’s funny to think she had anything to do with the war, Ktira imagined her mother led a very sheltered life, she enjoyed the home life, the only thing that seemed to make her more outgoing was her interest in the ascension powers, they had built up a lot of respect for her, and her mother and father we're practically honey on each other, it sometimes made her sick, two people shouldn’t be in love that much

Yes mom, Ktira asked respectively. She loved her mom and her mother knew how much she wanted to hunt. This wouldn’t take long.

Can you please take Katesh with you when you go hunting? He needs some outside time and I really haven’t gotten enough lately for him, his looking a bit dim.

Ktira nodded. Even if she would be looked down on for bringing the fire cat to hunting, she would have even more people writhing in agony, to make it worth it.

Let's go Katesh, maybe you with me we can hunt some really large prey, be careful, her mother admonished her

Yes mom, I will I'll be back before dinner

Katesh padded beside Ktira through the scrubline, tail flicking sparks each time he passed dry brush. The late sun turned the grass red-gold, and for the first time all day she could breathe like herself.

They tracked a hornback through broken stone for nearly an hour before Katesh froze and gave a low, warning growl. Ktira dropped to one knee and listened. Voices. Not hunters. Patrol cadence.

She crawled to the ridge lip and looked down into the old service road where three officials in city colors we're arguing with two village wardens over school allocations and training rights. The words came clear on the wind: mandatory curriculum, mixed enrollment, controlled ascension modules.

Ktira almost laughed. Even out here, school followed her.

One warden pointed toward the settlement lights below. "If you want the children to stay, teach them things they can use before the next crisis."

The official answered, "If we want a world that does not repeat the last regime, they need history as much as combat."

Ktira leaned back, annoyed and thoughtful at the same time. She wanted hunts, not lectures. But she had watched enough adults fail to know ignorance was its own trap.

Katesh nudged her shoulder, impatient. The hornback had moved.

"Fine," she whispered, rising into a crouch. "We hunt now. We argue with teachers tomorrow."

They took the ridge in silence and brought the hornback down clean before dark. By the time Ktira hauled the first cut home, she had already made a private bargain with herself: pass the classes, earn more field time, and make sure no one ever again had to choose between being educated and being capable.

When she reached the house, her mother met her at the door with relief, and her father inspected the kill with obvious pride he tried to hide. Ktira pretended not to notice.

Tomorrow she would sit through another lesson on old wars. Tonight, she had proven she belonged in the future those lessons we're trying to build.

She woke before sunrise to the sound of rain tapping the roof tiles and almost pretended to be sick so she could skip school. Almost.

At breakfast, her father slid a folded schedule across the table. "You pass this term," he said, "and I sign you for advanced tracking with the ranger corps."

Ktira narrowed her eyes. "That is bribery."

He smiled into his tea. "That is parenting."

Her mother did not look up from feeding Katesh. "And if your grades drop, no field certification. We are not arguing every morning for the next ten years."

Ktira groaned, but she tucked the schedule into her satchel.

School felt different after the hunt. In civic law, they studied the council charter and the old crystal codes side by side, marking where power had been hidden behind sacred language. In history, the instructor projected three conflicting accounts of the same battle and asked the class which one they trusted and why.

Ktira raised her hand before she could stop herself. "None of them completely. The person writing always wants something."

The instructor nodded. "Good. That is where analysis begins."

At midday training, students rotated through practical stations: map reading, signal discipline, first aid, and controlled ascent drills under strict output limits. The city-born children we're better at formal sequences. The tribal kids we're faster under pressure. By the end of the session, they we're arguing less and borrowing techniques from each other.

Ktira hated admitting it, but the hybrid model worked.

After class she met her friend Rin on the south wall, where apprentices watched cargo lifts bring stone, grain, and salvage from outer settlements.

"You still think school is useless?" Rin asked.

Ktira leaned on the parapet. "I think sitting still is useless. Learning is fine."

Rin laughed. "That is the most Ktira answer possible."

Two days later, Ktira got her first supervised ranger assignment: track missing livestock near the old canal and report, not engage, if signs pointed to armed scavengers. She and three other trainees moved through reeds in soft rain, reading prints, ash traces, and broken stems exactly the way her father had taught her.

When they found the thieves, they we're not raiders. They we're displaced families from an anti-ascendant district whose supply route had collapsed. Hungry, armed, and one bad decision away from becoming enemies.

Ktira's instincts screamed to confront them. Her training overruled instinct.

She signaled withdraw, marked coordinates, and relayed for mediation support.

By dusk, two wardens and one aid courier had reached the group with ration pledges and a relocation offer. No bloodshed. No retaliation cycle. Just a hard, boring solution that kept everyone alive.

On the walk home, Rin bumped her shoulder. "Old Ktira would have charged in."

"Old Ktira was reckless," she said.

"New Ktira?"

Ktira looked up at the city lights and the rebuilt towers beyond them. "Still reckless. Just better aimed."

That night she finished her homework before her father asked, then slipped outside to sit with Katesh under the awning while rain cooled the stone.

From the upper terrace she could see her mother finishing a late meeting with teachers, wardens, and two village delegates. They argued, rewrote, argued again, then signed something together and shook hands like people who did not like each other yet but understood the cost of failing.

Ktira scratched Katesh between the ears and whispered, "Maybe this is what hunting looks like now."

Not just chasing prey through grass, but tracking consequences before they turned into war.

Tomorrow she would still complain about class. She would still race to the wilds whenever she could. But she also understood, in a way she had not before, that the future her parents fought for required both sharp blades and sharp minds.
