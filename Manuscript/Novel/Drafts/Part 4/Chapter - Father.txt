Ksena entered the ritual chamber. She could feel her father’s presence. Kalani was a child. Her father had over a thousand years’ experience, including a war, and he had imprisoned her grandmother.

Father, please stop this, Ksena pleaded
Child, you do not understand. The war took everything from. This, it was only because we got this power that we could beat them. Back; we need to be prepared for them
It’s been over a thousand years and the hasn’t returned
That’s what she said. She wanted to ignore the threat they posed. If you are going to side with her, I will stop and imprison you and all your followers, include those invaders that have come from another planet in that ship.
They are only helping us
That’s what they all say but we can only rely on our power to hold the enemy back her father circled around the room, Ksena kept a close eye on him, he had her beat in every way, but the only way to save people would be o fight them
I don’t want to fight yo father. If you let everyone choose, we can stop this now
No, different opioun weaken us, we fight between ourselves and allow a spot for the enemy to come in
I have travelled with others that differ from me. Our differences didn’t make us weaker. We could cover for each other, I wouldn’t be here now without them.
Child silence, my view will not be changed. You will accept it or you will be imprisoned for all time after watching me destroy all your friends, including the humans.
Her father threw a fireball at her, Ksena pulled up a shield of flame, but his attack twisted it and had enough strength to knock her back, he didn’t give her a break, throwing blow after blow at her, knocking her into a wall and hitting her hard, if her own protection was not enough she would have been crushed against the wall
Ksena matched to throw a fireball back at her father, enough to give her a moment to catch her brief, but it wasn’t long before he pulled in closer and attacked her, Ksena fought back and dodged his attacks and deflected them enough to avoid damage, her father was showing no signs of slowly down and the room was getting destroyed with the ferocity of his attacks, small chips from the building where getting past her defences and she was soon bleeding from many small wounds
After a large attack, she was knocked down to the ground
Submit and serve me or I will kill you and your rebellion now 
No, I will not kill me, I will not let you win
Her father summoned a ball of flame and compressed it and spun it faster and faster, feeing more energy into it. If you do not submit, this attack will kill you.
Do it kill me
Ksena knew she wouldn’t be able to block it, just as he was about to launch it Ksena clenches her eyes close, she would die here, there was a roar and Katesh launched himself at her father, it wasn’t something he expected as its jaws bit into his arm holding the attack, her father lost control of the attack as he wrestled with the cat, eventually he could fling it at the wall, Ksena could hear bones break as Katash slammed into the wall, Ksena pulled out as much strength as she could and threw it at her father, the blows didn’t even phase him as her attacks hit, they were not enough, her father dismissed them with a dismissive gesture
If you will not submit, this is the end, using his other hand her father started amass power into it and walking towards her, Ksena pulled herself up to the pillar, Katesh was not moving in the corner and she was about to die at her fathers hand, as she brought his fist to punch her, Ksena grabbed the crystal from the pillar and used that to block her fathers attack
As the father’s attack hit the crystal, the crystal absorbed his powers and applied its control over him. As the one that set the original spell, feedback crackled between him and the crystal, he fell back as the crystal glowed hotter and hotter; it was trying to give him control over himself and the loop was reaching a peak. Her father glowed brighter. Eventually she couldn’t even look at him. She threw herself over the body of Katesh.
Her father was screaming. The screamers grew louder and louder until the explosion hit Ksena was showered in rubble and the crystal glowing hot with power literally sunk into the ground; the ground fusing over the top of it; it wasn’t until Ksena was found by Alcuin; he looked little better than her. He had been fighting multiple enemies, stopping them from entering.
What happened
My father is dead. I used the crystal to block his attack, and it pulled his powers from him, trying to force him to submit until he exploded. Katesh.
Ksena knelt down beside Katesh, pulling his head onto her lap. His breathing was shallow, but he was still breathing. Ksena hugged him gently. At least she hadn’t lost him.
What happened to the rest?
After the explosion, most of them feel unconscious, and the rest don’t seem to pose any threat at the moment, let's head towards your grandmother, ill pickup Katesh for you
Ksena nodded as Alcuin picked up Katesh Ksena started heading through the rubble, outside the room the city did not look like how she remembered much of it was blackened with flame, she had brought this to her city, most of the inhabitants that Alcuin had been fighting where huddled together and crying, between the loss of the shield and their leader controlling their actions, they looked towards Ksena and Alcuin carrying Katesh but made no movement towards them
Ksena stumbled along. The battle with her father had used all her power. She looked as powerless as when she first left the city. Ksena doubted she could even light a fire right now.
Her heart leaped into her throat as she saw her mother and grandmother hugging. They looked very similar ascendant, seem to stop aging once they reached full maturity.
Ksena used what little strength she had to run the final distance and collapse into her grandmother and mother’s embrace.
I am so sorry Ksena her grandmother said
His dead grandmother I killed him
It’s okay, you did what you had to do
Her mother pulled her into a tight hug. It’s okay. I understand what happened. I am worried I was powerless to do anything about it.
The crystals buried, it took all his power and melted into the ground
It’s better this way. We didn’t need the barrier, not now.
Ksena hugged her mother and grandmother tightly

 They had enough proof to challenge old narratives, enough power to defend themselves in a limited fight, and enough scars to avoid easy traps. That was not victory. It was readiness. The next chapter would demand more from all of them, but they entered it with clearer roles and fewer fantasies. 

 They listed what was confirmed, what was likely, and what was still dangerous guesswork. Then they decided the next movement window and who carried what risk. That process kept arguments from expanding into paralysis. When tensions flared, they redirected to tasks: perimeter checks, route sketches, ration control, and fallback markers. It was not heroic, but it kept people alive. 

 At first they were surviving exile. Now they were shaping a response to systems that had lasted for generations. That required more than courage. It required evidence, timing, and enough allies to hold the line when retaliation came. Every conversation with locals, every recovered record, every successful withdrawal without losses moved them one step closer to that threshold. 

 Ksena still carried anger toward the city, Alcuin still carried doubt about what they were becoming, and Kirk still carried mission pressure from a world that expected clean answers. None of those burdens were solved in one night. But they started speaking about them before the next march, which prevented silent fractures later. In a campaign built on partial trust, honest discomfort was more useful than polite silence.

 Open ground meant speed but exposure. Broken ridges meant concealment but fatigue. Old roads meant faster travel but predictable ambush points. They adjusted route selection based on weather and patrol rhythm, not pride. If the safer line cost half a day, they paid it. If a village contact looked compromised, they cut communication and moved. Hard choices stopped feeling exceptional. They became the baseline rhythm of moving through contested territory.

Ksena knelt beside the fire and pressed a stick through the coals until the flame settled low and steady. Alcuin watched the ridgeline while Kirk checked the map edges for marks they had missed in bad light. No one wanted another surprise attack bought by laziness. When they finally spoke, it was in short lines and clear decisions. They would move before dawn, avoid the open ridge road, and keep contact signs simple enough to read at a sprint.

Alcuin broke the silence first. 'If we get split, do not improvise. Fall back to the last water mark.' Ksena nodded, then repeated the instruction back to him exactly. Kirk added his own rule: no one fires or burns until everyone confirms target and range. They were done paying for panic with blood. The agreement sounded cold, but it was the first time all three sounded like one team instead of three survivors sharing a fire.
