Reconstruction moved faster than anyone expected and slower than Ksena needed.

Outer walls were patched within weeks. Water channels reopened by month two. Archive stabilization teams recovered enough pre-war records to challenge half the official history taught under crystal rule.

None of that fixed trust.

Village delegations still arrived armed. City families still crossed market lanes with old fear in their faces. Former enforcers still woke at night unsure which memories were theirs and which had been imposed.

Grandmother chaired the transitional council with equal city and tribal seats and zero patience for nostalgia.

"No forced ascension," she said at the first session. "No lineage quotas. No private command over ritual law."

The room erupted anyway.

By the end of week one they had ratified four enforceable rules:

1. Ascension by informed consent only.
2. Civilian veto on military operations inside population zones.
3. Independent review board for ritual training incidents.
4. Mandatory public logs for council decisions and emergency powers.

Alcuin handled what politics could not.

He led mixed crews rebuilding roads between settlements that had avoided each other for generations. First month: fights, sabotage, one attempted walkout that nearly collapsed flood-channel bridge work. Third month: shared tool caches, shared night watch, fewer knives drawn over old insults.

Pragmatism moved faster than forgiveness.

Ksena took the hardest portfolio herself: reproductive manipulation files and hidden lineage policy.

With help from human researchers who stayed behind, her team mapped exactly what the elder regime had altered. The findings were deliberate and ugly: birth-ratio controls, pairing restrictions, access gates disguised as sacred tradition.

When the records were released publicly, two districts rioted and five demanded emergency reform votes.

Ksena did not delay.

She opened hearings in the archive square, three days a week, under full transcription.

Mothers spoke about children assigned by policy. Sons spoke about ritual exclusion justified by bloodline myths. Former officers spoke with shaking hands about orders they remembered giving and not choosing.

Above the hearing table, grandmother ordered one line carved into stone:

Accountability without vengeance.

Easy to engrave.

Hard to live.

Technology transfer became another fault line.

Irrigation pumps and sterilization kits were accepted quickly because they solved immediate pain. Advanced fabrication templates drew suspicion, especially in anti-ascendant districts that feared a new monopoly hidden inside foreign aid.

Ksena shifted strategy from full-package rollout to modular pilots under local oversight.

Adoption improved as soon as control did.

Winter tested all of it.

Storms severed the northern route. Grain convoys stalled. Illness spread through two lowland camps. Rumor channels blamed every faction in equal measure.

Under old command, panic would have triggered crackdown.

Under the new charter, they triggered transparent rationing, rotating escort corridors, and public daily briefings regardless of embarrassment.

The crisis hurt.

It held.

By spring, schools graduated their first mixed class under joint curriculum. Ceremony banners carried both tribal patterns and old city script. Students ignored seating charts, laughed too loudly, and turned a rigid procession into something alive.

Ksena watched from the back with her daughter asleep against her shoulder and felt hope she did not fully trust yet.

That same week, the anti-ascendant mayor who had rejected her three times finally accepted a visit.

Ksena did not open with ideology. She opened with metrics: clinic outcomes, crop recovery, violence rates, audit logs, and transport reliability.

By the end of the meeting they signed one narrow agreement: shared water management and neutral medical access.

It was small.

It mattered.

At home, stakes looked different but no less real.

Night feedings. Interrupted sleep. Katesh demanding attention at impossible hours. Alcuin pretending he could function on three hours of rest. Grandmother correcting all of them with imperial certainty and, occasionally, quiet pride.

One evening, after the baby finally slept, Alcuin handed Ksena the marked draft of the long-range charter.

"We still have gaps," he said.

"We always will," Ksena answered.

"Then why does this feel different?"

She looked across a city lit by routes that had been dead for centuries.

"Because before, power was a cage," she said. "Now it is a responsibility that can be challenged."

He rested his head against hers.

Above them, the human relay blinked in slow orbit, carrying delayed messages from Earth and reminders that the wider galaxy would not wait for local healing.

Ksena folded the charter and set it between them.

"We are not finished rebuilding," she said.

Alcuin nodded. "No. But we are building something worth inheriting."
