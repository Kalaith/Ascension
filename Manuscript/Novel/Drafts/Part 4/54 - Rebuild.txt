The city didn’t take that long to recover from the attack, although the populous was still quite shaken, over being controlled, of evils committed during it and the fact that their culture had stagnated, the other elders we're quickly rounded up, the population was not very understanding of their position and going along with the plan, the ones not willing to repay their debt where imprisoned, although Ksena hoped they could eventually be rehabilitated, but they had been alive for a long time and very much set in their ways, a few people wanted to remove the threat, but with Ksena grandmother took over leadership as the oldest ascendant and she forbid it.

The population also was working with the tribes outside, as the orders of her grandmother, anyone among them wanted to be ascended was allowed, there population didn’t grow that quickly, there was a lot of mistrust that would not soon go away,

The old city for one had already declared itself as anti ascendant, Ksena tried to meet with the mayor but they had refused any overtones. Currently they didn’t pose a threat but it was something to monitor

One thing that still wasn’t going as fast as Ksena would have liked, she wanted to share their technology, which was the technology of both their people before the war, but the villages resisted every advance.

But in the end time was on their side, as long as they kept working at it, Ksena knew she had A lot of time, one day she hoped to visit the human planet but that wouldn’t happen until they had built a spaceship, some of the human scientists had actually stayed behind to both study and help with theory

Katesh made a full recovery, as her powers returned, so did his and it wasn’t long before it was back to normal, Ksena and Alcuin where now also expecting, Alcuin had got very upset when he learnt that ksena was actually pregnant during the attack, but what was done was done, and the humans science had already helped with checking the baby inside her, which they ad said she looked healthy, they we're going to have a girl.

This was one thing they had to look into, initial studies suggest the elders had actually changed things so they mostly had female children, with restrictions taken to be a mother, the young leader from the village was definitely having a good time, Alcuin had been approached, but Ksena didn’t plan on sharing
For now, all was right within her world. Her daughter would be raised in a world where she was not forced under any control, and mothers and fathers could now spend time with their children.

Reconstruction moved faster than anyone expected and slower than Ksena wanted.

The central districts reopened within months: water channels repaired, archives stabilized, power relays converted from elder-only control to council oversight. But trust did not follow scaffolding schedules. Village delegations still arrived armed. City families still crossed the market with old fear in their eyes.

Grandmother chaired a transitional council with equal seats for city and tribal representatives. The first sessions we're chaos, half accusation and half exhausted pragmatism, but they produced enforceable rules: no forced ascension, no lineage quotas, independent review of ritual training, and civilian veto over military deployments inside population zones.

Alcuin led mixed teams rebuilding roads between settlements that had avoided each other for generations. Work details became diplomacy by other means. People who would not share a table would still share a bridge when winter routes depended on it.

Ksena focused on the hardest file: reproductive policy records and genetic manipulations hidden in elder vaults. Human researchers who stayed behind helped map what had been altered and what could be reversed. The findings we're ugly, deliberate, and impossible to ignore. Public release caused riots in two districts and reform votes in five more.

By the time her daughter was born, the world was still fragile but no longer frozen. Schools taught both survival craft and civic law. Ascension training opened to volunteers from every community under transparent standards. Former prisoners from the old regime worked under supervision on reparations projects instead of disappearing into secret cells.

On clear nights Ksena sometimes stood on the upper terrace with Alcuin, child asleep between them, and watched traffic lights move along roads that had been dead for centuries.

"Do you think we fixed it?" he asked once.

She shook her head. "We made it fixable. That is enough for one generation."

Far above, a distant human relay blinked across the sky, slow and steady. The next chapter would be harder in different ways. For now, the city breathed under its own will.

The hardest work began after emergency repairs we're finished.

Grandmother insisted on a full public accounting of the old regime: detention records, forced pairings, ritual manipulation logs, confiscated property ledgers, and battlefield orders issued under crystal compulsion. People queued for days to read names and dates posted in the archive square. Some came searching for proof. Some came searching for apology. Many found both and accepted neither.

Ksena chaired the restitution board twice a week. She listened to miners whose sons had vanished into ritual service, to city families stripped of inheritance after questioning elders, and to former enforcers who could not tell where their will ended and the crystal began. Every hearing ended with the same sentence carved above the exit: accountability without vengeance.

It was easier to write than to live.

In the outer ring, Alcuin coordinated cooperative labor quotas that mixed city crews and village crews by design. The first month produced fights, sabotage, and one attempted walkout that nearly collapsed bridge construction over the flood channel. By month three, teams that once refused eye contact we're sharing tool caches and swapping night watch.

Pragmatism moved faster than forgiveness.

Kirk, preparing for long-term departure, helped establish the joint signal corps so inter-settlement alerts no longer depended on one political center. He trained operators in redundancy discipline: every critical message passed through three channels, logged in two formats, and confirmed by human and local teams both.

"Systems fail," he told the first graduating class. "People fail. Layer your failures so one mistake does not become a catastrophe."

The students copied the line into notebooks and into practice.

Technology transfer remained uneven. Irrigation pumps and sterilization kits we're adopted quickly because they solved immediate pain. Advanced fabrication templates triggered suspicion, especially in anti-ascendant districts that feared another power monopoly hidden inside "help." Ksena stopped pushing full packages and shifted to modular pilots run by local oversight committees.

Adoption improved as soon as control did.

When winter storms cut the northern road, the new council faced its first true stress test. Grain caravans stalled, illness spread through two lowland camps, and rumor channels blamed every faction at once. Under old leadership, panic would have triggered crackdowns. Under the new charter, they activated emergency statutes: transparent rationing, rotating escort corridors, and public daily briefings regardless of political embarrassment.

The crisis hurt, but it held.

By spring, the city schools had their first mixed graduating class. Ceremony banners showed both tribal patterns and old city script. Ktira and her cohort laughed too loud, ignored seating charts, and turned the formal procession into something almost joyful. Ksena watched from the back with her daughter in her arms and felt a strange, sharp hope she had not trusted yet.

Later that week, a delegation from the anti-ascendant mayor finally accepted her invitation.

They arrived guarded, suspicious, and prepared to reject everything. Ksena did not argue doctrine. She walked them through clinic outcomes, crop yields, violence metrics, and independent audit logs. By the end of the visit, they signed one narrow agreement: shared water management and neutral medical access.

It was small. It mattered.

At home, the world narrowed to quieter stakes. Night feedings, sleepless shifts, Katesh demanding attention at impossible hours, Alcuin pretending he could function on no rest, and grandmother correcting everyone with the authority of someone who had survived empires.

One evening, after the baby finally slept, Alcuin sat beside Ksena on the terrace steps and handed her a marked draft of the long-range charter.

"We still have gaps," he said.

"We always will."

"Then why does this feel different?"

Ksena looked over the city, at lights spread farther than they had in centuries, at patrol beacons moving on roads that now belonged to agreements instead of fear.

"Because before, power was a cage," she said. "Now it is a responsibility that can be challenged."

He rested his head against hers, both of them too tired to pretend certainty.

Above them, the relay light blinked again, patient as orbit. Somewhere far beyond that, Earth continued sending delayed messages, proposals, and warnings about a wider galaxy that would not wait for their healing.

Ksena folded the charter and set it on the step between them.

"We are not finished rebuilding," she said.

"No," Alcuin replied. "But we are building something worth inheriting."
