The path to the Ritual Tower was paved with glass.

The heat from the orbital strikes had fused the sand in the hanging gardens into jagged, translucent shards that crunched under their boots.

Ksena walked point. She didn't look left or right. The grief for Kalani was a cold stone in her chest, heavy and suffocating, but she used it. She let it anchor her.

They reached the Inner Gate.

It stood open.

"Trap," Alcuin whispered, signaling the squad to halt.

"No," Ksena said. "Invitation."

They stepped into the courtyard.

Her mother was waiting.

She wore the white silk of high ceremony, unstained by the ash that covered the rest of the city. Her hands were folded perfectly in front of her. Her expression was serene.

Too serene.

"Mother," Ksena said, stepping forward.

Her mother's eyes were dull, like polished opal. There was no recognition in them. Only programming.

"Access denied," her mother said. Examples of the perfect hostess refusing a solicitor. "The Architect is in session."

"The city is burning, mother," Ksena said. "Kalani is dead."

A flicker of something—pain? resistance?—crossed her mother's face, but it was smoothed away instantly by the command conditioning.

"The Architect is in session," she repeated. "Violators will be excised."

She raised a hand.

The air in the courtyard compressed. A concussive blast hit the squad, lifting them off their feet and slamming them into the garden walls.

Ksena rolled, gasping. Her mother—a woman who had never raised her voice in public—was shaping energy with terrifying precision.

"Focus fire!" Alcuin yelled.

"No!" Ksena scrambled up. "Don't shoot her! She's not doing this!"

"She's going to kill us if we don't!"

Her mother prepared a second strike, her fingers weaving a complex lattice of fire.

Then a wall of earth erupted between them.

Grandmother stepped from the shadows of the colonnade. She looked old. Older than the stone. But her eyes were sharp.

"Go," Grandmother said to Ksena.

"Grandmother—"

"I said go!" Grandmother slammed her staff—a twisted piece of ironwood—onto the pavement. The shockwave disrupted her mother's next attack. "This is not your fight, child. This is my failure."

Ksena hesitated. "I can't leave you both."

"You aren't leaving us," Grandmother said, her voice cracking for the first time. "You are saving what's left."

Her mother attacked again. A lance of white fire.

Grandmother caught it on a shield of woven stone, grunting with the effort.

"Go to him!" Grandmother shouted over the roar of the magic. "End it!"

Ksena looked at her mother one last time. She saw a tear tracing a clean line through the perfect makeup.

"I'm sorry," Ksena whispered.

She turned and ran for the tower doors.

Behind her, the courtyard exploded into a duel of fire and earth. The sound of her family destroying itself chased her all the way to the sanctum.

She didn't look back.

She couldn't.

The heavy doors of the Ritual Tower loomed ahead. They were carved with the history of her people—the landing, the building, the ascension.

Ksena put her hand on the latch.

"Here ends the lesson," she said to the cold metal.

She pushed them open.
