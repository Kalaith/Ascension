The path to the Ritual Tower was paved with glass.

The heat from the orbital strikes had fused the sand in the hanging gardens into jagged, translucent shards that crunched under their boots.

Ksena walked point. She didn't look left or right. The grief for Kalani was a cold stone in her chest, heavy and suffocating, but she used it. She let it anchor her.

They reached the Inner Gate.

It stood open.

"Trap," Alcuin whispered, signaling the squad to halt.

"No," Ksena said. "Invitation."

They stepped into the courtyard.

It wasn't empty.

**The Gauntlet**

The first line of defense wasn't soldiers. It was the architecture itself.

As they crossed the threshold, the statues lining the path—pristine marble figures of past Architects—turned their heads.

"Movement!" Estele yelled.

The statues stepped off their plinths. Automata. Hidden in plain sight for centuries.

"Standard formation!" Ksena barked. "Alcuin, bury them! Estele, precision fire on the joints!"

The statues were heavy, slow, but unstoppable. Stone fists pulverized the pavement where Ksena had been standing a microsecond before.

Alcuin slammed his palms into the ground. "Liquefy!"

The stone beneath the automata turned to quicksand. They sank to their waists, thrashing.

"Now!"

Estele fired a Lance of concentrated heat through the chest of the lead statue. It exploded in a shower of superheated gravel.

But behind the statues, the real threat emerged.

The Elite Guard. The Red Sashes. Men and women who had sworn personal oaths to the Architect, bypassing the civic oath entirely.

They didn't speak. They just opened fire with high-frequency pulse rifles.

"Shields!" Ksena screamed, throwing up a kinetic barrier.

The blue energy of the barrier flared as it absorbed the impact.

"We can't hold this!" Alcuin shouted, reinforcing her shield with a wall of granite. "They have suppression fire!"

"We push," Ksena said through gritted teeth. "On my mark. I drop the shield, you throw the wall."

"What?"

"Do it! Mark!"

Ksena dropped the barrier.

For a split second, they were exposed.

Alcuin roared and shoved. The granite wall didn't just fall; it flew. A ten-ton projectile of stone that smashed through the Elite Guard line like a bowling ball.

Broken bodies and bent rifles scattered.

"Move!" Ksena sprinted through the gap, her sword flashing. She cut down a guard who tried to rise, not slowing down.

They reached the inner sanctum courtyard.

**The Mother**

Her mother was waiting.

She wore the white silk of high ceremony, unstained by the ash or the violence just outside the gate. Her hands were folded perfectly in front of her. Her expression was serene.

Too serene.

"Mother," Ksena said, stepping forward.

Her mother's eyes were dull, like polished opal. There was no recognition in them. Only programming. She wasn't seeing her daughter; she was seeing a threat assessment outline.

"Access denied," her mother said. Her voice was flat, synthesized. "The Architect is in session."

"The city is burning, mother," Ksena said. "Kalani is dead. She burned herself out to save the wall. Your daughter is dead."

A flicker of something—pain? resistance?—crossed her mother's face. Her left eye twitched. The verified biometrics fought the programming.

"Kalani... logic error. Subject status: Active."

"She is dead!" Ksena screamed. "He let her die! Coping mechanism failed!"

The silver collar around her mother's neck pulsed with a frantic red light. The conditioning was struggling to suppress the grief.

"The Architect is in session," she repeated, her voice rising in pitch. "Violators will be excised."

She raised a hand.

The air in the courtyard compressed. A concussive blast hit the squad, lifting them off their feet and slamming them into the garden walls.

Ksena rolled, gasping. Her mother—a woman who had never raised her voice in public—was shaping energy with terrifying precision. It wasn't wild like Kalani's fire. It was exact. Mathematical.

"Focus fire!" Alcuin yelled, raising his rifle.

"No!" Ksena scrambled up. "Don't shoot her! She's not doing this! It's the collar!"

"She's going to kill us if we don't!"

Her mother prepared a second strike, her fingers weaving a complex lattice of fire.

"Target lock: Ksena. Threat level: Absolute."

"Mom, please," Ksena whispered.

The fire released.

**The Matriarch**

Then a wall of earth erupted between them.

Grandmother stepped from the shadows of the colonnade. She looked old. Older than the stone. But her eyes were sharp.

"Go," Grandmother said to Ksena.

"Grandmother—"

"I said go!" Grandmother slammed her staff—a twisted piece of ironwood—onto the pavement. The shockwave disrupted her mother's next attack. "This is not your fight, child. This is my failure. I let him build this."

Ksena hesitated. "I can't leave you both."

"You aren't leaving us," Grandmother said, her voice cracking for the first time. "You are saving what's left."

Her mother attacked again. A lance of white fire.

Grandmother caught it on a shield of woven stone, grunting with the effort. She pushed back, turning the stone into vines that wrapped around her mother's legs.

"Saria!" Grandmother shouted at her daughter. "Look at me! Break the loop!"

Her mother screamed, a sound of pure mechanical agony. "Order! Must maintain order!"

She shattered the stone vines with a pulse of telekinetic force.

The two women clashed. Fire against Earth. Order against Root.

The courtyard turned into a storm of elements. Trees were uprooted. Fountains boiled.

"Go to him!" Grandmother shouted over the roar of the magic. "End it!"

Ksena looked at her mother one last time. She saw a tear tracing a clean line through the perfect makeup.

"I'm sorry," Ksena whispered.

She turned and ran for the tower doors.

Behind her, the sound of her family destroying itself chased her all the way to the sanctum.

She didn't look back.

She couldn't.

The heavy doors of the Ritual Tower loomed ahead. They were carved with the history of her people—the landing, the building, the ascension. Lies carved in gold.

Ksena put her hand on the latch.

"Here ends the lesson," she said to the cold metal.

She pushed them open.
