# Finding the Destination

"Okay, we are done here," Estelle said. "Where are you guys off to? You mentioned the other temple."

Alcuin spoke up. "We believe the next temple is located further north from here."

"North... hmm, I have traveled up further north but I do not recall any temples in that direction."

"The map was pretty vague. I do not think we would have found this temple without a guide, so I do not know how we can find the other temple."

Ksena had remained mostly quiet. Estelle and Alcuin knew the terrain better, but she felt like she would be able to find the temple if they got close enough.

"Perhaps I can help," Kirk piped up.

"How can you help?" Alcuin asked.

"Well I do have a flying ship. It's located in space and has a view of the entire planet. If you can give rough directions from here, I can ask them to look at the location. I think they would be able to find the temple, or at least put us close enough to the area."

Ksena nodded, her eyes lit up with excitement. This would be it! If she could visit this temple...

"But what should we do about your sister?" Estelle piped up. "She attacked and destroyed the villages near here, and she attacked the city as well."

"I can't do anything about her until I visit the temple at least—when I'm on an equal footing with her."

"I think we should warn the villages nearby though. Perhaps Alcuin... you can come with [me] and Kirk, and Ksena can find the temple and we can meet back up in the city."

Ksena got a little alarmed when she said that. She wanted Alcuin to stay with her, but she couldn't bring herself to say it.

"I'm sorry, I want to visit this temple as well."

Ksena struggled to hide her relief, while Estelle sighed. *He seems quite stuck to her.*

"Hmm I do not think it would be good to travel alone out there though," Kirk said. "Let me contact the ship and get the information we need. Once we have that, I can go with Estelle and you two can go together to the temple."

"I do not think I need your company that badly," Estelle said to Kirk.

Kirk just laughed. "I do not want to be left alone with these two."

Estelle laughed in response. "Okay I'll get our things together and let me know when you're ready to leave."

Ksena blushed a little; it had been a while since she had been alone with Alcuin.

Alcuin just shrugged. Something was happening to him outside of the desire to be with Ksena, and he knew this next temple would have the answer for him. Something was changing. He felt it throughout his body. Even if Ksena for some reason gave up visiting the temple, Alcuin would have gone alone.

"Do you need help getting your pack ready, Ksena?"

"I'm all good. I can leave when Kirk has the information." Alcuin felt a little different from normal. This trip was less about her... and she didn't know why.

Alcuin nodded. At least Ksena had become a little more reliable in traveling. They had traveled far from home now. The constant exercise was definitely having an effect on her body.

## The Call

Kirk walked away from the rest. While it was no secret, he did want a little privacy while calling.

"Base come in, this is Kirk."

"You're early for your report in. Is anything up?"

"I do have some information and a request. Can you please get the General?"

"General, Kirk is on the transmitter and wants to speak to you."

Kirk could just hear the General's voice over the speaker. "Transfer it to my station."

"Will do. Kirk, I'll transfer you now."

"Thanks."

"How is your mission going? My reports say you arrived at the temple you were after."

"We did. They did their ritual."

"What happened during it?" the General asked.

"As far as I can tell... Ksena and Alcuin held hands, and fire covered her body as well as spreading over Alcuin as well."

"So you think their ritual is producing results?"

"I do. Ksena said the next temple should be the last so we can get into the beacon room."

"Okay, keep me posted on this. I heard you had a request?"

"Yes. They have a general idea where this temple is but they do not know for sure, so I was wondering if we could pinpoint the next temple."

The General thought about it.

Kirk responded, "They will find the temple eventually. I want to speed this up."

"I see. Okay, I'll have our people look. Do you have an idea? This is a big planet."

"I do. They said it should be roughly a week traveling north from my current location."

"Oh not that far at all. I guess these temples were all surrounding the city, so it makes sense they are close."

"Hold on for a bit, and I'll get the information."

...

"I have more information and a request."

"Go ahead."

"At the temple we came under attack by Ksena's sister—the one that also shot down my plane and as far as I can tell is also attacking villages in the surrounding area."

"That's not good. Did you use your own firearm against her?"

"I did, but it wasn't effective. These ascendants wear flames much like a normal person wears clothes. It seems effective as armor for a lot of projectiles."

"That's not good."

"Yes I know. In terms of us versus them, I think they would be able to win in a fight, unlike the other natives who only seem to use basic hunter/gathering weapons."

"Okay, we are not looking for a fight, but please try and find more information about this. Anything else?"

"Well I was hoping after I get the directions for Ksena, I can actually travel with one of the other companions. She seems to know a lot more about the system. She is heading to nearby villages. We were going to meet back at the city. I will arrive earlier in the city than Ksena can make the trip."

"Hmm, okay I approve. After all, it seems like the message is coming from the natives. I would like more information on Ksena as well as this ritual they go through, but I think we need to learn more about the city and you have already made contact with the Mayor."

"I have. I think being separated from Ksena and Alcuin would also help with that."

"Okay, I'll do the search for that temple you're looking for and let you know. Otherwise keep in contact."

"Yes sir."

Kirk was happy with how the conversation had went. While this mission was having his up and downs, progress was happening and even an end in sight. He headed back to the camp. Hopefully by the time everything was ready, the General would have the information on the temple.

## The Coordinates

"Did you get the information?" Ksena asked.

"I've asked for it. They are looking it up now. I really do not think it will take them that long."

"Okay, thanks for doing this for us. I know you must be in a strange spot."

"It's fine, this planet has plenty of interesting things."

"Do you have better control over those flames now?"

"Uh huh," Ksena responded and she held her hand flat and a flame sprang up from her palm. "I still do not know about the things like the armor, or make the fire as big as my sister, but it's close."

Kirk nodded; the flame was definitely impressive. Alcuin was also watching while packing up his own things. Watching the flame, Alcuin wanted to do it himself. For some reason he thought he could. But what does it mean? Is it because he was with Ksena during the ritual? Is some of her power rubbing off on him? He had never seen or heard of his own people using flames, or why the temples showed thousands of his own people with an ascendant during the ceremony.

His concentration was broken from a buzz from Kirk. Kirk grabbed his intercom. Ksena wanted to lean in even closer. This was it—the final temple. Once she did that...

"Hi Kirk, I have the information you asked the General about. We have found what looks like a temple. It's very similar to the temple you're currently at."

"Okay, can you give directions on reaching it? Mind, I'll have to draw a map by hand."

"Will do. The temple is as you said and roughly due north-west from your direction. For you... I would say 8 days walking."

"Do you have any landmarks? I won't be with them at the location."

"Sure, the temple is actually near the largest lake on this continent. You would actually struggle to miss it. If you head north-west... straight north you might miss it."

"Okay that helps. Anything else?"

"Hmm, to the west is a lot of mountains, likely how the lake got so big, fed from the mountains. If you reach the lake and are close to the mountains, follow the lake in the other direction. The temple is actually partially buried in the lake, so hopefully the parts you need are still there, but if you follow the shore you can't miss it."

"Thanks, that should be enough information. Let the General know I'll let him know once we have met back up at the temple."

"Will do, be safe."

"Thanks, seeya."

Kirk turned to Ksena and Alcuin's direction. "Do those instructions make sense to you?"

Alcuin nodded. "I think that should make sense. I am a little worried if the temple has sunk into the lake."

"Me too," Ksena said. "But we won't know until we check in person. And 8 days of walking... we should leave shortly."

Alcuin nodded in agreement. "I have a couple more things. We can leave in the next 10 mins."

"How are you going?" Kirk asked Estelle.

"I'm ready when you are. Okay well I'm good to go, so let's head off then, and we can meetup in the city. Let's see... 8 days. I think try to be at the city no later than 20 days. That gives a couple of extra days. Longer and we will have to come looking for you."

"Okay, bye you two. Do not do anything I wouldn't do," Kirk said, making them both blush and Estelle to laugh before they set out.
