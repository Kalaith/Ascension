# Use of the Crystal

It's been thousands of years since we were forced off the planet, but now it was time to return. The mistakes of the past would not be replicated. Last time was a mistake; they were underestimated. Their technology had not progressed since we were forced off the planet and sent to drift in space, but they somehow found a way of overcoming their natural limits to form some ascended creature who wielded power we could not fight against. We were forced to retreat, but before we were, we implemented a plan.

These ascended... they took in power to transform into frightening monsters, but we found one that was greedy. He wanted all the power to himself. To him we offered a jewel. This jewel had been crafted by our scientists. The goal was originally to trap their power in it, but it wasn't ready. It needed more power before we could use it, but for now it would allow us to control our enemies in the future. It will give them power over each other and we will come back.

Our plan had both succeeded and failed in ways we didn't imagine. The city full of ascendants was ours to control through the crystal, but they no longer had it. It was stolen during the night and taken away. We suspect the person has found the truth, but it didn't matter. We had an army, and what our army had done was subjugate the world, hoarding the ascendant power for themselves.

We are also not returning empty-handed. The orb they have was only the start of our technology updates. We have created newer and more advanced crystals that could turn the ascendant power into our own planet.

As I look down on the planet that was formerly our home, I felt it call, and we would answer. Nothing would stop us this time. We would remove these blights on the planet and when they no longer polluted the ground with their process we would finally regain our ancient home.

## History

Our nations had originally grown together. We raced each other in competition. Wars were fought, won, and lost. Our people were finally beaten. Using the last and greatest of our scientists, we developed an ark that would be able to survive in space. It would not be the same, but at this rate, our people were being forced off the planet.

After we left, while their research stagnated, ours grew with our fury at being forced off our own planet. We waited as generations grew up and died, until we had forged a new empire in the stars. We attacked, but it was not to be.

## The Return

It was worse than he had imagined. The wars that had claimed his people had another effect of destroying all of their cities and culture. They now raised children in the graveyards of our biggest cities where millions had died. This wouldn't do. Now that they were back, they would remove these savages from their land and their mighty cities would rise again on the ashes of their fallen enemies.
