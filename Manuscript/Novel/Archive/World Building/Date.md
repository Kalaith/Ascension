# The City Tour

The town was massive. Ksena thought it must be easily 5 times the size of her city, and that's with her city built like it is. It extended even further as they have expanded. She had never thought the villagers would have such a large city. It's a shame they didn't know how to continue. The history, as far as Ksena could find out, was that the city was left unoccupied for a couple of hundred years and it had been found and populated. No one knew why it was empty. There was damage to the building to show it had gone through some type of war, but no one knew anything about the war that happened.

Alcuin was just as shocked. His village was tribal, and while the city had elements of tribalism, a lot of the city residents were quite modern. Some were working on trying to understand the city and extend it even further. Both their mouths gaped as they explored the city. They also got a lot of stares in return; this was the first time the people in the city had seen an ascended.

Ksena stood fairly close to Alcuin as they walked around. She wasn't letting off a bad vibe, but she did feel uneasy being the center of attention. Alcuin was also a bit embarrassed being seen with her—more than a few raised eyebrows—but he wasn't protesting her close presence, and it might have even raised his own confidence, even in such a foreign city.

They had met earlier with the Mayor. *Mayor*—such a strange word, Alcuin thought. Every other tribe had an elder, but the Mayor was because the city was so big. The city had absorbed many smaller tribes, or people that left their tribe for any reason. From his discussion with the Mayor, there was also a council of elders who made a lot of the big decisions, but his job was the day-to-day keeping the city running. Outside the city, they had made use of agriculture; the ground was developed with various crops and also other animals for food. It made sense; the city was too big. If they just used tribal hunting techniques, they would not be able to support the population.

## Underground

Later in the day, the Mayor took them for a tour of the city underground. Kirk had joined them for the tour. While Ksena was unusual, a human was completely different and would cause too much confusion, so he stayed inside. Under the city, the Mayor went over how the machinery in the city worked. Ksena had seen a lot of this in her own city, but it was different. Since the machinery was abandoned for a few hundred years, some of the systems no longer worked, and a lot of the city workers actually worked underground replacing prior machinery with hard labor. It was also less clean down here; compared to her home city that was near spotless, this city had piles of dirt and dust everywhere. But it was still amazing to her, and the Mayor was happy to see their reactions as well. He had spent a lot of time working under the city and adding machinery back for things like running water to each house, although he often felt the limits of not being able to replicate a lot of it. If something broke, if it couldn't be repaired, it had to be replaced with less optimal machinery.

Touring through the facility underground, he brought them to a door.

"This is the only door we haven't been able to open. We have a feeling that the room might actually be the Central Hub for the city, but we have found no way inside it. I thought since you're from the ascended city where everything works, you might have a way of opening the door."

Ksena stepped up and had a look at the door and panel. At first, she tried all the standard mechanisms for opening the door, but as the Mayor said, the door wasn't budging.

"I don't think I can be of help, Mayor. Not yet, anyways. I believe this door was actually shut by an ascended and only another one can open it."

"Aren't you an ascendant?" The Mayor asked.

"I am currently on a trip to earn my ascendant powers, but at the moment I'm not a full ascendant, which you would need for this door. Have you tried asking help from my people?"

The Mayor shook his head. "Unfortunately no. I asked if they could help with the door and the machinery, but the answer was no. In a way, the people from your city felt that we villagers don't belong here. But I disagree; I don't know what happened in the past, but I am sure my people once lived in the city."

Ksena nodded. "I did notice some of the structures didn't quite match what we have at my city. I could see this as maybe one time my people came and helped build this city and left and built their own city, but I don't know how."

"Mayor, I am on a quest to unlock my powers. We found one temple towards this end, but there are others out in the world that I need to visit. One of the things I wanted to ask was: do you know of a guide that might know of other temples? I only have information on the general direction of them and nothing specific."

The Mayor looked thoughtful. "Knowing of this city, we did send search parties out to try and find other ruins. They mostly were out of luck, but they did find some structure. From memory, it was pretty much empty, but the surveys sent did think it used to be a temple. They described pictures on the wall that looked like some sort of ceremony. We didn't actually spend much time; we were more on the lookout for technology to build the city, and when it didn't look like the temple had any of it, outside of the normal doors and lights, we left it alone. I'll find someone that was on the survey team. But when you become ascended, would you consider coming back and helping us with this door? There are also a couple of machines I think ran out of power since they just stopped working with no obvious problems."

Ksena nodded. "I would be happy if I can. I still don't know for sure if this journey will unlock my ascended powers, but if it does, I'll come back."

The Mayor nodded. This was his best chance. He didn't tell Ksena that the city didn't just say *no*—the city got punished by the ascendants, and soon the city will be too far gone and people would be forced out.

## The Repair

Kirk enjoyed the tour immensely. The technology was a lot different to human technology, but in parts, he thought it actually might be more powerful and advanced. Human machinery still looked so rough, but this machinery, even if very dirty, was definitely as form-pleasing as it could be while doing its job. The fact that it had even lasted this long was amazing. It was a shame about the door though; the beacon he was after was definitely behind that door. And now he wouldn't be able to gain access without Ksena being ascended first. But who knew how long that could actually take? And if an ascendant locked the door, even if they opened it by force, whatever was put behind it might be damaged or destroyed. He would have to report back to his captain that their mission would take longer.

From his understanding, the research teams were keeping very busy with the satellites they retrieved as well as studying the planet. It was definitely different from Earth since it didn't seem to have the large amount of water, but from what he could gather, this water was actually mostly underground. In that way, they might actually be above Earth; ocean water had to be desalinated first, but as far as they could judge, the water on this planet was mostly clean. It also didn't have the same terrain. While it wasn't a big desert, the rainfall in general was a lot less, so the plants tended to be hardy, making most of the planet one large plain with the odd lake and river.

*I wonder what our guide will be like,* Kirk wondered. These two almost felt cloying to be around. They had an obvious interest in each other, but both rejected it, which he could understand. He didn't even know how biology worked on this planet, but still, it would be nice to have someone other than the love birds. The females of Alcuin's species were not quite like Ksena; there were definitely similarities, and despite the fact that it was a different species, the females here weren't that much different from human females—a little taller overall, and the facial structure was different, but still not completely unattractive.

The Mayor continued his discussion as they went back to the surface, pointing out anything he might have missed. They did stop in front of one of the devices that did stop working suddenly.

"This was handling the lighting for this district, and one day it went dead, and we lost all lights. You might have noticed everyone had to adapt to have fires."

Ksena nodded; she had noticed it.

"Do you think it's something you can fix now or is it something for an ascended?"

Ksena had a look. She had seen a similar device at the city, but she wasn't architecturally curious enough to have paid that much attention to how the city was maintained.

"I am not sure, to be honest."

Kirk piped up though. "Sorry, I know I'm not familiar with your technology—it's a lot different from my own—but do you mind if I take a look?"

The Mayor hadn't really paid attention to the human. He still didn't trust him. From the Mayor's understanding, this human had come down to explore the planet, but it's not like the girl was much help.

"Please do. One day it just stopped working and we haven't found a cause. But to be honest, we are using this technology without fully understanding it. Perhaps with a different view, you might see something we missed."

Kirk kicked himself for speaking up. He wanted to help and had spoken before he realized; now he was kind of stuck. But something about the device did look familiar to him, and he felt he might be able to do something.

Walking to the machine, Kirk had a look over it. It did have a control panel similar to the doors, but it was unresponsive, so it must not be getting power for whatever reason. Kirk found what he thought might be the cables—they didn't look like cables but still—and started tracing them along the structure. The others watched him closely, especially the Mayor. He didn't know what the paths meant, but if this human did, it could mean a lot for his city and tide them over until getting access to the door.

Eventually, Kirk found the spot where multiple cables interacted. It was buried under a shallow amount of dirt. He carefully moved it out of the way. If this was power, he didn't want to accidentally hurt himself. After moving the dirt, there was clear damage just to the section that went from the device he came from. The Mayor took a close look as well, leaving Ksena and Alcuin to mostly hang around.

Kirk said to the Mayor, "I think you will find this is the problem. Compared to human tech... since this looks like a resistor board, it regulates the power. This one looks like it's blown up—perhaps a surge on the system. I would see if you could find a replacement, perhaps from another broken machine. The other problem you will have is power will be coming from this direction; you should turn off or disable the power into this."

The Mayor nodded excitedly.

Kirk nodded to where the cables went after this junction. "I would trace this back and you might be able to find where the master power plant is for this place. But be careful; it might have a safe way to turn off, but turning it on might require that control room you have access to."

"Thanks, I will get my people on this right away. I can't believe we never noticed this. I feel kinda dumb for not paying attention."

Kirk nodded. "It's fine, if you had never seen these devices before and how they work correctly, one thing can look the same as another."

"I'm sorry," the Mayor said to Alcuin and Ksena, "we will have to end this tour early. I really wanted to get you back and get people down here." Ksena could see how excited he was about all this.

"Thanks for your hospitality and showing us around down here."

"Thanks for your attention towards this."

"My thanks as well for coming down here. Between you and Kirk, I felt like our understanding of this structure just took a large jump. Let's go. I'll guide you back to the surface and you can rest. Tomorrow I'll have organized the guide for you as well so you can continue to that journey of yours."

## Aftermath

The Mayor was down with his engineers. They had traced the wiring back. Although it had been quite a task, with every step they learned something new. As well as finding the center power room that had been half-buried, they also found ways of shutting power down to areas. They would be able to do the repairs safely, and a project going forward was to restore this room so it was structurally safe. If any more damage happened to it and the entire power plant shut down, it would be the end of the city.

This would be enough for now, the Mayor thought. This came at an ideal time; many people were starting to question the Mayor as things were starting to fall apart. And the lights were not the only system they had now been found to be affected by the same issue. There were a lot of rooms that had never worked since the city started, and what was in the rooms might start to change things around for the Mayor. Weapons they could use against the ascendants threatening them? But the other ascendant will have to be kept in the dark. They would need that control room still, so the Mayor was happy to get them out of the city for now, and after they had unlocked the door, the Mayor would have to see.

Kirk regretted helping them a little. Something felt wrong about the entire situation. He tried to talk to Ksena about it, but she was just excited they had been able to help. And as their newly updated group left the city, the previous wood-fire lit streets now hummed with energy. The people seemed happier and excited to see them. The Mayor had not been quiet on who was responsible, so a lot of their confusion about what he was, was replaced with amazement.

There was their new guide—she was even worse news, and the naive Ksena didn't even see it. This guide of theirs had eyes for Alcuin and she wasn't even being that discreet about it. Alcuin at least looked embarrassed about the whole situation. Their guide did clearly look capable though; Kirk figured in a fight she could probably handle herself.

The Mayor watched them go. Although it was hard, they had worked through the night and already today the city was back to being lit up. And there were so many other devices they had managed to fix, so many new things to learn. One of the sites was actually industrial and could build replacement parts. This, of course, had sent every engineer under him into overdrive. The city was starting to give up its secrets within a day of the strangers being here. By the time they finished their journey and came back, the Mayor was going to revitalize this city and throw off the yoke the ascendant had held over him all this time.

As soon as they were out of sight, the Mayor jumped back into work. They would need more people. At least with machines already being fixed, a large amount of the population had just had their job replaced by a machine and needed something else to do. He would have all hands on deck to get the city moving. They didn't have long. If the ascended did learn they had restored so much of the city this quickly, it wouldn't be long before they arrived, and the Mayor needed to have his plans finalized. He also hoped that girl was able to be back by then.

Also, these human visitors offered a path that didn't exist [before]. That Kirk had been born around technology, and if they had a ship that could fly in the sky, they would have a lot of knowledge. The Mayor wanted it all to himself. He had to find a way to be able to get his hands on it. Between the two techs, he would control all the power and it would finally be time.
