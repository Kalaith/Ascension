# Humans

"Kirk could you tell us more about humans? You came from a different planet, could you describe what it's like?"

Kirk looked up and nodded. "Well our planets are fairly similar. I would say ours is more blue; water covers most of the Earth's surface."

"Are there any other species other than humans?"

"Well, humans are the only sentient species. We have creatures like monkeys and apes which are similar, but they are covered in fur and use only very rudimentary tools."

"This trip will amaze everyone back on Earth, knowing that two different sentient species shared a planet and this enemy of yours means we went from 1 to 4 in a very short space of time. Which means the universe is likely full of a lot more we haven't met yet."

"Do you have any spaceships here?" Kirk asked.

"No," Ksena nodded. "Ascendants don't need ships and Alcuin's people use horses and carts for transport."

"That's interesting. I wonder when it stopped. When we arrived, we found satellites floating around the planet."

At the look of Ksena's puzzled face, Kirk replied, "Maybe they were from the invaders? None of the ones we collected were active anymore."

Ksena nodded and looked thoughtful.

"Is space interesting?" Alcuin asked.

Kirk nodded enthusiastically. "Space is very big and amazing. There are so many sights to see, although we didn't actually get to see much."

"Wasn't your trip a few years?" Ksena asked.

"Yes it was, but on the spaceship, we have hibernation chambers, which basically freeze you and you sleep for the entire time."

"Wow you slept for years, that must have felt like forever."

Kirk shook his head. "Not really. For me, it felt like we were just about to start traveling here when they froze me, and when I opened my eyes again your planet was beneath us."

"That is interesting, who flies the ship?"

"The ship for the most part is under autopilot, but there are a few crew members that don't sleep and help maintain the ship."

"Your ship sounds pretty amazing."

"Mmhmm. Discovering that there were aliens out there, I think, got everyone to work together on the planet, so the ship is really a representation of humans working together."

"Do humans fight each other?" Ksena asked, her eyes a little wide.

"We do have some history of conflict, for many different reasons. You seem quite lucky; it looks like your two species do not seem to have many conflicts."

Alcuin replied. "Her species tends to keep to themselves and ours... we haven't had any major conflicts. Most tribes are far enough apart we are independent, and if there are any problems, the wronged side will usually receive gifts to make up for it."

"What if both sides feel wronged?"

"Both sides give each other gifts. We like to give gifts, so usually even if it's only one side, both sides still usually get the gifts."

"What sort of gifts do you give?"

"Well... goods, materials, horses... usually crafted goods are also popular."

"Sometimes the hunters will go out on a joint hunting trip and both tribes will meet up and we have a large party with whatever the hunters find."

"Sounds like a good life. How did you get exiled from that?"

Alcuin looked away and Ksena looked down.

"I was exiled for failing my ascension ritual, and they thought it might have been because I spent too much time with Alcuin's tribe."

"So my city elders forced Alcuin's tribe to exile someone, and they picked Alcuin, which is all my fault."

"Before her ritual, I did one of our village coming-of-age rituals on Ksena, so that's why they singled me out."

Kirk nodded; he could tell this was still a sore point between them.

"So what are you trying to do now?"

Ksena spoke up at that. "Well when my ritual failed I saw flashes of images, and at the start, we found an ancient screen that showed some of those images and also a map of the area from ancient times. So we are traveling to the locations to see if we can learn anything."

"But other than that I do not really have anything. The city was the only place my people are located, and since I was exiled from my city, the tribes nearby do not want anything to do with me. Alcuin is forced to travel with me to look after me."
