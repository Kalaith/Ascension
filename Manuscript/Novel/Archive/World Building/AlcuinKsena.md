# Alcuin & Ksena

Ksena is a sheltered girl, very innocent but curious. She comes to visit us "lesser" species often, but with her, it never feels patronizing. She sees how we do things and is genuinely interested in doing them. If the rest of her people were like her, the world would be a much better place. It's not that her people are cruel, but in the end, we pay them taxes in the form of material and food for "protection." But really, the only other thing out here that is dangerous is them. It's less an exchange of goods and more extortion.

They could share some of their secrets. We don't even know what secrets they have because of that barrier. It's such an eyesore on the countryside—red like the color of blood, seen for hundreds of miles in all directions.

But back to Ksena. Well, she might be a little attractive. In terms of height, she is shorter than I am, and her frame is delicate. Other females within the camp are actually a little jealous of her. Ksena is as light as a feather, although her body doesn't look starved considering all the food we send her people. No one in the city is going hungry.

Ksena is a good girl who does everything her parents say, or at least her mother. She never speaks of her father, but it doesn't appear to be because of anything happening to him. From what Ksena said, he is part of the leadership within the city and spends all of his time working. It just seems normal for her, like the passing contact is considered sufficient. Her mother and sister are both full ascendants as well, and from what Ksena has said, they are just as busy as part of the army.

## Kalani

Her sister used to visit as well. Kalani was more attractive than her sister; I think half the young males in the village doted on her. But after her Ascension ritual, we haven't seen her once. I asked Ksena about it, but she just said her sister is very busy. Previously, the two sisters were inseparable despite the age difference. But as well as Kalani not visiting, Ksena seemed more reserved now and visited more often. I think her household was now very lonely.

## Connection

While I might have had the biggest crush on her sister, Ksena has been more like a little sister, especially after her sister's Ascension. I think having me as a big brother was just what she was after. I worried about her ascension ritual. Would it be like her sister's? Would the day before her ritual be the last I would ever see her again? Just what did they do in the army that kept them so busy? I don't know of anyone they are at war with. I asked our elders, but they didn't know anything more.

Ksena said there was no war, just training, but something was not right. I know they don't have anything beforehand. Ksena and Kalani never had chores to do; they were expected to just play until the ritual, as if they had to have all their fun beforehand. From what I could pull out of Ksena, Kalani wasn't having fun, but she wasn't upset either—just so focused that it was bordering on fanatical.

## The Ritual

I haven't told anyone in the village yet, but I was going to try our coming-of-age ritual on Ksena. Perhaps in some small way, it would help her after her ritual. I have already lost Kalani; I didn't want to lose my adopted little sister either, even if she could be annoying (I think little sisters are meant to be). I had intended on doing the ritual for her sister as well, but on the day before her ritual, we had to go out hunting. I tried to get out of it, but they just said "you can see her after the ritual." This time I wouldn't let that happen. There was already news about a hunting trip to go out, and I had determinedly said I was not going.

This time they didn't even try and fight it. I wasn't the only one that missed Kalani, especially since the sisters were our only link back to the city. The elders wanted to encourage positive relationships with them, but it was a little hard. Before the two sisters, only a select group of people were sent for the exchange of goods—usually the elder and the head of the hunting team. The rest of us had never seen a real ascendant before. They wear armor made of flame, and their power sent a chill down the lead hunter's spine. "They are dangerous," he warned, and that's all we could get out of him or the elder.

I had seen the lead stand in the way of many beasts, and for him to be afraid of these ascendants... but their demands were not exhaustive, and we weren't the only village. So while we knew to be wary of them, we didn't live in fear. It also meant that Ksena was not seen as the bringer of doom but just a way to get to know our benefactors better. We were all encouraged to be on our best behavior around her, but she was so innocent about it that despite that, most of the children in the tribe got along with her well.

I hope that one day Kalani does come back. Ksena has been around us longer since she was the younger, and her big sister intrigued us. I can't believe that Ksena would become ascendant and stop talking to us, and when she is an equal with her sister and still wants to visit, Kalani will come as well.
