# The Beacon

If Ksena had pulled attention to herself when she first got into the city, now that she and Alcuin had both ascended, the people didn't try to work. A crowd followed them back to the mayor's house. The mayor was just as shocked as the rest of the populace. They had only seen one ascendant, and with the attack, they had spent most of the time hiding away. Now both a female and a male stood before them. Ksena spoke first to break the silence.

"Mayor, I've returned to try and unlock that door. Between me and Alcuin, I am sure we will be able to get the door open now."

The mayor gaped at Alcuin. "How did this happen? You were one of us. Did she transform you? Is she a witch?"

Alcuin shook his head. "She was involved, but it was visiting the ancient temples of our people. They gave me the energy to transform into this. Ascended are simply those of us that have gone beyond our normal limits. But I think behind that door we learn the truth, so I think we should have a look."

The mayor nodded, his mouth still gaping. "I will take you there right away. We have made a lot of progress since you left—more in the last few months than the hundred years beforehand. So we know more of what we expect to find behind the door."

Ksena nodded.

Kirk would finally get into seeing this beacon as well, but he didn't know how many more shocks he could take. The power from these two made earthlings seem primitive instead. No wonder they were able to fight off the enemy.

The mayor led them down. It was a lot different now; the area was cleaner. All the people previously working on machines were now more focused on cleaning since a lot of the repairs had reactivated the machinery—enough to restore the used sections of the city.

There was still the entire manufacturing side of the city they didn't have access to. If his own people could become ascendant, the number of ascended would soon dwarf them. While the mayor was proud of the changes, most of the journey was spent with him brooding on what to do now. They wouldn't be ready. One ascended they might be able to handle, but two? By the time the mayor reached the door, he decided to call off his plan for now. There would be other times when they are better prepared to handle them. A lot would also depend on what they learned on the other side of the door.

Ksena stepped up to the door first. Her new powers showed her symbols that she didn't see before. Placing her hand on the panel, at first it did nothing, but then Ksena covered her hand in flame. The mayor, not used to the display, jumped back at the sight. The display flashed under it, and the door started to open.

The room beyond was dark, but it was much larger than anyone expected. It had rows upon rows of consoles and a large display. This place would need a small army of people to run it, not to mention it would take a long time to unlock all the secrets.

Unlike the rest of the area, this place had been sealed since the war was finished. The air was stale, and the room was just as it had been left. Likely, the ascendant that last used it had sealed the entire room from any intrusions.

In the darkness of the room was one flashing console. They all moved closer to check it out. Since none of them were that familiar with the technology, and for Kirk, this light was likely the whole reason he sat down at the terminal first. Pressing the display, the screen lit up. This was definitely the beacon he was after. He wasn't that used to the letters, but he was familiar enough to run basic instructions. Pressing a couple of buttons, his screen flashed and soon the back of the screen was lit up. It was the message that was being sent out by the beacon.

## The Message

The start of the message was familiar to Kirk; everyone on earth had heard the message. The request for help, a foreign attacking power. For Alcuin and Ksena, they had lived through all of this, but for the mayor and the others in her party, it was a lot of shock—this stuff had been hidden.

"There is a second message," Kirk said. "I do not think this one is being sent out and was recorded afterwards."

Playing the message, the screen was lit up by someone who was definitely among the ascendant.

"Hello, my name is Ksera. I am a member of the new faction of ascended. By concentrating the power from thousands of our people into one individual, that individual is able to unlock their inner potential and become like me, an ascended. Our former enemies are destroyed. We were able to master this ritual and a number of the priesthood became ascended, and we were able to destroy the enemy attacking us. This should have been a moment of celebration for our people—we have become something more than we were. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Power corrupts an individual, and the leader of the priests, Zvera..."

Ksena gasped at that name, since that was the name of her father. She went quiet to listen to the rest of the message.

"...Zvera was able to control the majority of those that become ascended. In his thoughts, ascendant powers was too much for the general population and should be restricted. I opposed him, but I was alone in this effort. Zvera started by destroying most of our cities and temples and stopping anyone else from becoming ascended.

"This is the last city. I have tried to hold out here, but soon the city will be conquered.

"Zvera already led his people to form a new city of just ascendants. A barrier has been placed that I have found I can't penetrate. If I had more time, maybe, but I am sorely outnumbered. There is nothing I can do now but leave guides for ones that come after this. Eventually, they will become complacent, and I can only hope our people unlock their potential again. I am leaving this message for you so you know who did it and why. We are still new to being ascendants. We do not know our lifespan, or children. We will find out soon though." The image lowered her hand to her stomach. "I am with child, which is why I will no longer be fighting until they are grown and can look after themselves. I only hope I am not found before then.

"If this message has fallen into other hands—those not of our people responding to the distress signal sent out long ago—I plead with you to try and help our people get out from under their oppressors."

## Aftermath

The message cut off, leaving the room in dead silence. The gravity of the message left everyone speechless. It had different meanings for everyone.

Ksena... this was her father. She didn't know who the female was; she had never seen her in the city. And if Zvera was the same as her father, this meant he had lived thousands of years, and she could still be alive as well.

For Alcuin, who had become ascended, this affected him deeply. In a way, he was the final result of the messages and hints left—the first of a new transcendent.

The mayor had his distrust of ascendants grow into a cold rage. The ascended sent his people back, and not only that, they kept them back and not letting them advance. The attack on the city was proof of that.

For Kirk, who had come, this finally answered the questions he was after. He had recorded the message and he was sure his people would want to see it straight away. Earth was used to people in power misusing them, and being here now, he felt that this request was the final detail in what he needed to do.

The rest were somewhere between the two extremes—hate at the one that did it, hope it was now happening.

"I can't see any other messages," Kirk said. "This system is a lot more advanced, and I am hardly a linguist."

The rest nodded. The mayor looked over the equipment. The language was similar but more advanced than they were used to. As soon as they got out of here, he could get his people in here working around the clock to find out how to make the city fully operational.

The mayor nodded. "Please come back to my residence. This news has been shocking, and I think we will all take some time to fully process this."

They all followed the mayor back. The mayor had claimed the larger house in the town, and they were all able to split up.

As soon as Kirk was alone, he was quick to contact his superior and send all the information he found. Afterwards, he sat and relaxed on the bed. The beds were a lot different on this world; he suddenly felt a bit homesick. But still, after traveling this much, he wanted to see this through. It would depend on his superiors' thoughts, and in the end, this was more of a civil war than a foreign invasion. Would they be right participating? That was something Kirk was not sure on himself. He knew which way he would go, but he had been among these people for a while now, and he fundamentally disagreed with the path the ascended had taken. It should have been the people's choice.

Although if everyone on this planet was ascended, Kirk thought Earth would be very worried. These people as ascendant are living weapons and quite powerful ones at that.

Ksena retired with Alcuin. Her father was the leader of the ascended. Everything that had happened to her had been because of the decisions he made when he led their people. She also wondered about the female on the screen. Who was she? She was the same as the projection which had directed them into this. Likely that projection had more information than what it revealed. Maybe it was a precaution. And what would they do now?

Her sister was against her, and from what she said and the fact that Ksena had been exiled, Ksena didn't have any reason to doubt it.

Her people were locked under the rule of her father, and Ksena doubted anything would change while he was in charge.

Alcuin was worried about Ksena, knowing her father was the one that did all this. And what would they do now? Two ascended was not enough; they would need more. They needed a way for his people to take control back from the ascended who had taken it away.
