# The Empty House

They found the house. It was at the location specified, but the house looked like it hadn't been lived in for...

Ksena was first. She was so excited that she would meet her, she ignored all the signs of the property being abandoned. It wasn't until she arrived in the entryway... Inside the house, everything was burnt. Whatever had happened here, it had been a fight. Ksena collapsed onto her knees. She did not expect this. She should have; the recordings were made a long time ago, and if she had been alive, wouldn't she have done something by now?

Ksena felt loss. What would they do now? If she wasn't here, what's the point? They are in no position to do anything against the other ascendant.

Alcuin came up beside Ksena. "Let's search the house. Perhaps we will find some clue about what happened." Although it looked fairly obvious what might have happened.

Ksena nodded, standing up. They wouldn't find anything in the entryway.

## The Secret Room

They spent a few hours going through the house. When they finally found it, it was more a stumble than a find—a hidden location in the house. Ksena pressed her hand against the hidden switch, sending her power through it like the door at the city. With a click, it opened and a set of stairs opened up below it. Ksena felt her heartbeat pick up and her energy renewed. Surely they would find something here.

This room was a lot like the first they found. It was smaller and had one central display and a console. Sitting down at it, it wasn't powered, but Ksena was not going to let that stop her. Sending her own power into the machine, it slowly came to life.

What they found were video records left by the former owner, and not just her, it showed a young child as well.

As they watched through the videos, the child grew. It wasn't until the child was about 6 years old when Ksena recognized her. It was her mother... But her mother was in the city. What had happened? She watched the tapes, watching as her mother got older. The last recording was when her mother was about 13 years old. If it was in the city, she would be doing the ritual soon, which she must. The tape showed her grandmother and father fighting. At one point during the fight, one of his people had brought out his mother. Based on the tapes, he forced her to surrender and that was the end of the tapes.

But she had never seen her grandmother in the city. So does that mean she is being kept as a prisoner of her father for all this time? Ksena felt a little sick to her stomach. Her father, who she had once trusted, used her mother as leverage to control her grandmother. And to rub salt in the wounds, he later fathered two children with her mother. The age difference didn't mean much. Her and her sister were still young and this means her mother was possibly one of the first children to undergo the ritual. She had been under her father's control for over a thousand years. Ksena clenched her fists and her power flared around her.

## The Plan

Once they got out, Ksena made a declaration. "We have to go to the city and find and rescue my grandmother. If she is still there, they have held her prisoner for over a thousand years."

"How will you get inside the barrier?" Kirk asked.

"The barrier was designed to stop non-ascended. I didn't have my powers when I left, and Alcuin has never been in the city. I think as long as we avoid the guards—something I already have some experience with—we need to get in and find her. I think if my father was the one that took her prisoner, we will find her prison near where he is located, so I think I already have a good idea where we will find her."

Kirk nodded. "For now let's return to the ship. Perhaps we can learn something from the scientist studying the barrier. I also think a run past might be a good idea but would need permission from my commander to do first."

Ksena nodded. "Thanks for your help. Without you being here I do not think we would have any way of doing this successfully. Me and Alcuin do not have forever to spend training before we will be forced into combat."

Alcuin nodded. Even more so for him—he didn't grow up surrounded by ascended, and he had not had a good chance to practice control over his powers since becoming ascended.

## The Flight

Alcuin was a little regretful they had to get back into the jet. It did not make him comfortable. Katesh handled it well, considering Katesh couldn't buckle on or hold the seat. He was likely relying on his power. Alcuin would use his powers more but he didn't want to accidentally light the plane on fire, so he would just have to bear it. Kirk had none of the ascended powers and yet he flew the plane at that speed, which made Alcuin impressed with Kirk for that. Even if he wasn't able to do much beyond that, humans had really extended their power with machines instead of powering themselves. Alcuin wondered if humans or other creatures had their own form of transformations like theirs.
