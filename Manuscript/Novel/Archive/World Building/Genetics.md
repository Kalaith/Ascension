# Genetics Analysis

The head researcher said he had news. He seemed quite excited; the General had never seen him this excited before. Whatever the news was, it must be big enough to rattle his top researcher. Coming to his room, the General knocked on the door.

"Come in!" The head researcher was there in an instant ready to open the door. He must be really excited.

"You said you had news. What's so important that you wanted to have a meeting this urgently?"

"We have been studying the population and including the ascendant..."

"So what news do you have about it?"

"Well, have a seat." The scientist went over to his table and poured a drink for him and the General.

"I am still on duty."

"Relax, I think you will need a drink after you listen to what I have to say."

Bringing the drink over and placing it in front of the General, he sat opposite and had a mouthful while the General stared him down.

"Both the ascendant and normal population have a similar structure, and we spent a lot of time when we had the crystal and the changes in the two aliens you brought aboard, and the results are just astounding."

The scientists had another mouthful before continuing.

"As far as we can tell, when one of them becomes ascendant, it's a bit like their genes have been split and internally they become like a fusion reactor—like the sun—constantly generating heat, which is why they are draped in flame. It seems that before the war the society was heavily religious, and they found a way to focus their combined energy and basically use that on the target to force their atoms to split and go into fusion generating energy. The energy they produce also replaces most of their bodily functions and as far as we can tell their lifespan would be about the same as a newborn sun."

The General's eyes widened at that, and he grabbed his drink and had a sip.

"So you're telling me that this race of ascendants is basically an incarnation of a sun and they like live for a few billion years?"

"Yes that's about right. Each one of them has about the same strength as every weapon on Earth. If they fully developed their powers they could wipe a planet out at a whim."

"This makes them a lot more dangerous than we expected, and we have currently made an enemy of the majority of their population."

"This is where the crystal comes in. The crystal does a few things but I can tell you they did not build it. That crystal was created but not by them."

"If they didn't who did?"

"Their original aggressors. It seems the crystal was designed to absorb and store their powers. When they use the crystal to unlock their ascension it actually suppresses their abilities. Still dangerous mind you, but not beyond our realm of control."

"Why would they use it?"

"Well it seems as well as suppressing it also rewrites parts of the brain basically turning them into slaves, but I doubt they understand it, and it seems it was too late to save the creatures that attacked them."

"Likely the first of the ascended didn't use it. They found it afterwards and decided to use it. That's likely why their civilization has become stagnant; they are waiting for orders from masters that do not exist."

"Do you have any more information on these enemies?"

"Yes, we think we might even know the direction they came from. Although our initial studies have said the invasion was more an accident. We think it was a lot like our ship designed for long-term travel through space and they made a mistake. I would say it would take our ship a couple of thousand years to reach them."

"That far, huh," the General said. "So I doubt they are going to come back any time soon, if they even know what happened."

"With the control... is there any way we could possibly gain control over it?"

"I thought you might ask. I looked into it but I do not think so, not with our current technology. It seems to be an advanced version of quantum computing; we can barely see it let alone take control over it. I think the invaders that attacked scientifically were much further ahead of us. It's no wonder they would have won. The population down there has some interesting technology. I would love to study their city more. I was able to spend some time in the city but the Mayor was hesitant on revealing too much. To be honest I think he's more dangerous than the ascendant right now. He's bringing back their technology they haven't used for over a thousand of years, but doesn't fully understand it, so things could go wrong."

"I'll ask Kirk to keep an eye on him. Going back to the topic before, do you know why Ksena was unable to be controlled by the crystal? From what I heard it backfired."

"That one is interesting. The children of ascendants need to have basically their cells... hmm, shaken. I do not know if that ritual they talked about would have done anything. Her brain chemistry could be different from normal. But I would say it was an inert reaction from another one of the ascended using it... but who or why I can't say. She was just really lucky."

"If we had arrived and she was not there to meet Kirk, I think we would have had to assume the war was already lost and already be on the way home."

"Good luck for us. At least we will have plenty to take back with us, should make the people happy."

The scientist nodded. "I am a little worried about the future though. As I said the crystal suppressed the powers, but now there is a dozen ascendants who were not under the control of it, and the number is going to start growing. Eventually the whole population could be ascended."

The General nodded. "The officials on Earth wouldn't like that."

"In a way it might have been better if we were not involved. Now the planet poses a future risk to Earth."

"Do you have any suggestions?"

"Well the ship contains a fusion reactor of its own. I think if we could capture them we would be able to hold them."

"They are living beings we can't do that."

"I know, just saying you did ask."

The General nodded. "Well Ksena is currently in charge and as you said they live for a long time so as long as she remains in charge I think we could maintain a positive relationship."

The scientist nodded. "We can see this but I worry how it will go down on Earth. In a way these aliens are the epitome of superheroes in powers compared to humans."

"Could the same procedure be done on humans?"

"No I do not think so. Biologically compared to the aliens here we are developed very differently. I do not know how they control their powers, but I think if the same thing was done to a human, they would just explode."

Discreetly the General coughed. "As you know Kirk and one of the natives are very attached. Is there any possibility of something happening there?"

The researcher looked up at the General who actually looked like he might be blushing.

"Well as I said our makeup is completely different, so I do not think we would be compatible. It's surprising that the act is similar between our two races."

"And we do know it's possible for a non-ascendant to get an ascendant pregnant."

"We do?" the General piped up.

"Yes. Ksena was pregnant before the final ritual. We did a test after she was on board and the child looks to be healthy. We think since they are so similar at least the females can still breed with the males. I would estimate though that a female non-ascendant would be able to get pregnant by an ascendant male—it may be possible, but the mother wouldn't have the natural power."

"Didn't you say Ksena got pregnant?"

"Yes but she was a dormant ascendant so her body is still able to give birth to another dormant ascendant as well."
