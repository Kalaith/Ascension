Ksena had never entered her father's residence.

From the outside it looked ceremonial, all polished stone and narrow windows. Inside it felt like a machine pretending to be a home. Too clean. Too quiet. No personal objects, no scent of cooking, no stray fabric left where someone had lived a real day.

Alcuin closed the door behind them and listened.

"No guards in the front rooms," he whispered.

"That means they trust the barrier," Ksena said. "Or they want us to think they do."

They split and moved fast.

Ksena found the laboratory first. Glass cabinets lined one wall. Old war fragments sat in numbered trays. A console glowed with technical logs, most of them classified under her father's command seals.

She scrolled through ritual entries with shaking fingers.

Control lattice calibration.

Ascendant compliance drift.

Conduit thresholds by bloodline.

Her stomach turned. The crystal system was not governance. It was architecture for obedience.

She copied what she could to a storage shard and moved on.

A second door led into a lower corridor that did not appear on city maps. At the end stood a sealed gate keyed to ascendant signature.

Ksena pressed her palm to the plate. Heat spread through the lock. The gate opened.

The chamber beyond was dark, narrow, and cold.

A woman hung from suspended restraints in the center, wrists bound above her head by dull red metal. Her skin was pale, her hair silver and matted, and every breath looked borrowed.

"Grandmother," Ksena whispered.

The woman's eyes opened by a sliver.

"Do not touch the chains," she rasped.

Alcuin checked pulse and stepped back. "Alive. Barely."

Ksena forced her voice steady. "We're getting you out."

"Not with brute force." Grandmother's words came in short bursts. "Shackles drain any ascendant who grabs them. Your father keyed them to a regulator gem. Red crystal. Ritual chamber. Bring that, then break the restraint circuit."

Ksena swallowed. "The same crystal he uses for control?"

Grandmother gave a faint, bitter smile. "The smaller governor node, not the core lattice. Still dangerous. Keep skin contact minimal."

"Why did people follow him?" Ksena asked.

"He saved us in war," grandmother said. "Then he turned emergency authority into permanent rule. By the time we understood, many were already bound."

Her gaze sharpened, focusing on Ksena's face.

"Your mother?"

"Alive. Controlled."

Pain passed across grandmother's features so quickly Ksena almost missed it.

"Then we move now," grandmother said. "Before he returns."

They left the chamber and sealed it behind them.

Outside, city patrol density had doubled near the ritual district. From an observation niche, Ksena and Alcuin watched her father and several elders circle the pedestal in synchronized calibration.

No opening.

Alcuin pulled her into shadow.

"We need a split plan," he said.

"Too risky."

"Everything here is risky. Listen. I pull attention to the barrier edge and ritual quarter. You take the gem and free her."

Ksena shook her head immediately. "If they corner you in open air-"

"Then I run. I'm better at that than anyone in your city."

She hated that he was right.

They hid in an abandoned housing block until second watch. Alcuin dozed in short intervals, one hand on his blade. Ksena stared at the ceiling and counted breathing cycles to keep panic from owning her.

Near dawn, patrol patterns shifted. Smaller teams. Wider gaps.

"Now," Alcuin said.

Before he moved, Ksena grabbed his jacket and kissed him hard enough to interrupt his next sentence.

When she pulled back, both of them were breathing too fast.

"Forest rendezvous," she said. "Old marker stone."

"Do not miss it."

He went first.

Minutes later, fire lit the eastern sky. One blast struck near the ritual tower. Another hit outer wall plating. Then more, staggered to imply multiple attackers.

Sirens rose.

Patrols launched.

Ksena ran low through side streets, never taking open lanes, never flying where sentries could track her silhouette. At the ritual chamber she found the red governor gem seated inside a containment ring.

She wrapped it in cloth before lifting it.

The stone pulsed against her palm like a second heartbeat.

By the time alarms retuned, she was already halfway back to her father's residence.

Inside the lower chamber, grandmother hung where she had left her.

Ksena pressed the wrapped gem to the restraint lock. Red arcs flashed across the shackles, then snapped out. The chains fell open.

Grandmother dropped.

Ksena caught her by sheer force of will and bruised shoulders.

"I have you," she said.

Grandmother could not stand on her own. Ksena shifted her weight, slung one arm over her back, and half-carried her into the upper corridor.

They reached the study entrance.

Kalani stood in the doorway.

Her smile did not reach her eyes.

"I knew you would come here," she said. "You were always predictable where family is involved."

Ksena tightened her grip on grandmother. "Move."

"No."

Kalani's flame lifted around her shoulders like a living cloak.

"You are not leaving with the prisoner," she said. "But if you surrender now, I can keep you close."

Grandmother leaned into Ksena and whispered, almost soundless, "Do not negotiate."

Ksena felt the wrapped gem burn hot through the fabric at her belt. She set her stance, measured distance, and looked directly at her sister.

"Then stop me," she said.
