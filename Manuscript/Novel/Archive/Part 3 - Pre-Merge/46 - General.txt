General Hale had reviewed the operation plan twelve times and still did not like it.

Not because it was sloppy.

Because it was necessary.

His mission profile had been simple on paper: respond to distress beacon, establish contact, provide aid if feasible.

Reality was uglier.

The original war referenced by the beacon had ended centuries ago. The active conflict now was an internal fracture built on old victory myths, forced ritual control, and resource asymmetry between factions that no longer trusted the same history.

Intervention risked escalation.

Non-intervention guaranteed consolidation by a coercive regime.

Hale sat alone in briefing room two with holo-map projections cycling over his desk.

North shield arc.

South seam intervals.

Civilian density overlays.

Extraction vectors.

He called in Kirk, then Ksena, then operations lead Nguyen for separate challenge reviews.

Same question each time.

"What fails first?"

Comms drift.

Seam timing.

Civilian panic.

Friendly-fire confusion in mixed teams.

He logged each answer, cut two optional objectives, and rewrote abort criteria in bigger font.

By final briefing, the room held human officers, local liaisons, and a silence that meant everyone understood consequences.

Hale did not raise his voice.

"One pass only," he said. "If seam does not open on schedule, we abort. No hero reruns. No improvising past abort line."

Ksena met his gaze.

"Understood."

Plan structure locked.

At 03:00, controlled barrage on northern arc to pull defenders.

At 03:02, strike element enters southern seam during timed weakness.

Objectives in order:

1. Recover grandmother.
2. Secure crystal records and control protocols.
3. Extract before target profile is recognized.

Kirk handled synchronization, forcing every watch in the room to the same second with drift checks every five minutes.

Alcuin drilled entry stack in hangar until each member could run route blindfolded.

Hale walked the line once before dismissal.

No speeches.

Only equipment checks and one reminder.

"We are not here to conquer," he said. "We are here to open a window and get people out alive."

After most of the room cleared, Ksena remained.

"You still think this might be a mistake," she said.

Hale did not lie.

"I think every intervention is a mistake in the wrong hands," he said. "I think doing nothing can be a bigger one."

She nodded.

"Then give us the window. We'll carry the political cost ourselves."

"Good," Hale said. "Because you will."

At 02:48, final launch checks began.

At 02:56, weather shifted east exactly as forecast.

At 02:59, Hale stood behind operations glass and watched mixed teams seal helmets and weapons.

At 03:00, northern arc lit with distraction rounds.

At 03:02, southern seam signal turned green.

Hale exhaled once and said the words every command hates and needs.

"Execute."
