The fleet arrived like weather turning violent.

Ksena saw the first hull break cloud and felt old fear move through her spine before thought caught up.

Then more shapes followed.

Carriers.

Heavy escorts.

Fast wedges peeling toward strategic corridors.

Within minutes the sky was no longer sky. It was occupied geometry.

Kirk lowered binoculars and did not bother softening his read.

"That is not reconnaissance," he said. "That is staging for control."

Alcuin spread a cloth map over a flat stone and anchored corners with spent casings.

"If they hold these three canyons," he said, tapping each route in turn, "lowland supply dies in two days."

Ksena forced herself to count instead of panic.

Hull spacing.

Descent vectors.

Escort pattern.

Whoever commanded the formation had studied terrain and chosen pressure points deliberately.

"Western settlements first," she said. "If passes close before warning, half the civilian population gets trapped by dusk."

Kirk keyed his headset and transmitted burst priority to orbit command.

"Captain can shadow edge lanes," he said, listening to static and delayed confirmations. "We cannot contest full orbit alone. Ground movement starts now."

Ksena nodded.

The sky above was terrifying.

The ground beneath her boots still required decisions.

She split routes in under a minute.

Alcuin to ridge clans and canyon wardens.

Kirk to aerial recon and comm relay.

Ksena to city gate council and emergency corridor authority.

No one argued.

They moved.

At the first fork, Alcuin caught her arm.

"Do not negotiate from guilt," he said. "Negotiate from leverage."

She almost laughed at the timing.

"When did you become strategic?"

"Around the third city trying to kill us."

He ran west.

Kirk launched with two scouts and climbed toward cloud shelf where radar shadows were thin.

Ksena took the south trail at full speed.

By the time she reached gate council, rumors had already outrun facts.

Some argued immediate surrender to avoid bombardment.

Some demanded preemptive strikes on suspected collaborators.

Some denied fleet identity entirely and called it human deception.

Ksena waited until shouting peaked, then ignited a narrow line of flame over the center table just high enough to command silence.

"Listen," she said. "You do not need to trust me. You need to count timelines."

She outlined descent windows, pass vulnerabilities, shelter capacities, and evacuation order in hard numbers.

Panic did not vanish.

It became operational.

By nightfall, warning runners were moving west, grain convoys were redirected, and first shelter sectors were opening under mixed supervision.

Above, fleet lights shifted into lower holding patterns.

The invasion had not started yet.

It had announced itself.

On the ridge outside council hall, Ksena paused once and looked up at the darkened sky.

Her ancestors had faced this enemy and survived long enough to leave warnings.

This time the world they left behind was fractured, suspicious, and underprepared.

It was also not helpless.

Ksena touched the signal bead at her throat and sent one short message to both Alcuin and Kirk.

"Routes active. Civilians moving. We hold." 

Wind answered first.

Then two confirmation tones returned, one from west trail, one from cloud layer.

She turned back toward the city and kept walking.

The enemy had arrived in force.

This time they would meet a world that remembered and adapted.
