Ascension tore through Ksena like lightning finding a path it had always wanted.

Heat wrapped her skin. Sound sharpened. The temple floor seemed to tilt under the force of new awareness. For one breathless moment she thought she was alone inside it.

Then she felt a second surge.

Kalani rose from the far side of the chamber, fire streaming over her shoulders in bright, violent bands.

Ksena took one step toward her. "Kalani?"

Kalani smiled, and the smile looked wrong.

"Thank you," she said. "You finally did what I needed."

Ksena froze. "You are free from control. We can end this together."

"Free?" Kalani laughed softly. "I am free from them. Not from ambition."

She lifted her hand. Flame folded into a spear-point and fired.

Ksena barely got a shield up in time. The impact threw her backward into the altar. Stone cracked under her shoulders. Her new power held, but only just.

"Why?" Ksena coughed, dragging air back into her lungs.

Kalani's eyes hardened. "Because I stopped your ritual the first time and still failed to break you. Because you kept surviving. Because you would have become mother's favorite story forever."

"You burned villages."

"I obeyed while bound. Now I choose."

She took another step, gathering enough fire to melt carved stone.

"And I choose rule."

The next strike never landed.

Alcuin slammed into the gap between them, one arm raised, flame arcing from wrist to shoulder in a thin, trembling barrier.

Kalani's attack hit his shield and split across the chamber walls, carving black lines into ancient masonry.

Alcuin's knees buckled. He held anyway.

"Move!" he shouted to Ksena.

Ksena got to her feet and pulled energy into both hands. Her control was raw, unstable, still finding shape, but she forced it into narrow channels and fired at Kalani's flanks to break her rhythm.

Kalani dodged and laughed.

"You still think this is about justice," she said. "The strong command. The rest follow."

Ksena stepped forward, breath ragged, blood on her lip.

"No," she said. "The rest survive each other. That's what you forgot."

Power slammed through the chamber again. A central column shattered. Blue crystal sparks rained from ceiling seams. Dust turned the air into smoke.

Kalani used the chaos well. She vaulted through the breach, launched upward, and vanished into the ruined corridor before Ksena could lock her down.

Silence arrived in jagged pieces.

Alcuin dropped to one knee, one hand still half-raised out of reflex.

Ksena knelt beside him and grabbed his shoulders.

"You should have stayed back," she whispered.

"Not from you," he said.

Outside, city alarms began to ring, one district after another, until the whole skyline pulsed red.

Kalani was loose, fully ascended, and no longer pretending to be anything but a threat.

Ksena stood and looked through the broken wall into rising smoke.

One ritual had not ended the war. It had changed its shape.

She offered Alcuin her hand.

"Then we train harder," she said. "No second surprises."

He took her hand and got up.

Together they walked out of the ruined temple toward the next fire.
