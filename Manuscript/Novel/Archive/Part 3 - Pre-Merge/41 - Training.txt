Grandmother started training before sunrise and ended it after dark.

"If you only perform well when rested," she told them, "you are ceremonial fighters, not survivors."

The yard held seven trainees: Ksena, Alcuin, Estele, two village volunteers, one former city guard who had broken from crystal conditioning, and a quiet teenager who had never held power output above spark-level before this week.

It was not an army.

It was what they had.

Morning block was fundamentals.

Breath cadence.

Posture under load.

Channel shaping without flare.

Grandmother walked the line with a cane in one hand and zero patience.

"Control first, output second," she repeated until everyone hated the phrase enough to remember it.

Ksena could generate raw output faster than anyone in the yard, but anger still spiked her patterns and caused instability. Alcuin held cleaner lines, especially on precision drills, but his endurance dropped in longer sequences. Estele adapted fastest in paired work, reading timing cues before most commands finished.

By midday most hands were blistered.

No one was dismissed.

Afternoon block shifted to movement and decisions.

Split formations.

Civilian shielding drills.

Controlled retreats through narrow terrain.

Contact protocols when comms failed.

"Power does not make you soldiers," grandmother said. "Choices do."

That line stayed with Ksena through the third run when she overcommitted to an offensive push and left her rear flank open. In a real fight, two civilians in the simulation would have died.

Grandmother stopped the drill and made them reset from the beginning.

No shouting.

The disappointment was worse.

After supper they ran silent coordination under moonlight. No spoken commands, only hand signs and movement markers across broken stone.

They failed twice.

On the third run they moved as one line.

Not smooth.

Sufficient.

Grandmother leaned on her cane and gave a rare, thin smile.

"Better," she said. "Not ready. Better."

Ksena wanted another hour. She also nearly collapsed when adrenaline wore off.

Grandmother saw it before she did.

"Eat," grandmother said. "Then sleep. Pride burns faster than power."

Alcuin laughed once through exhaustion and dropped onto a crate beside her.

"If she says one more wise sentence tonight," he muttered, "I am defecting to a less wise army."

Estele handed him water.

"No you are not."

"True," he said. "But I reserve the right to complain."

Before lights-out, grandmother gathered Ksena and Alcuin aside.

"Your father expects brute force and emotional mistakes," she told Ksena. "Do not give him either."

She turned to Alcuin.

"And you. Stop matching Ksena's overtraining out of loyalty reflex. You both crash, everyone dies."

Alcuin nodded, chastened.

Ksena did too.

At dawn the next day, they ran integration drills with live stressors: smoke, noise, uneven footing, and rotating command handoffs when designated leaders were removed mid-sequence.

The quiet teenager froze on first pass and nearly quit.

Ksena took her aside between rounds.

"I froze too," she said. "Do the next step, not the whole battle."

The teenager returned and finished the run.

By the end of week, output metrics were up, burn incidents were down, and cohesion scores had doubled in paired tests.

Still not enough.

But no longer fragile.

When they finally broke for the night, Ksena sat on the training wall with sore shoulders and soot streaked across her jaw.

Alcuin climbed up beside her and passed over half a ration bar.

"Think we are ready?" he asked.

Ksena looked down at trainees cleaning the yard in tired silence.

"I think we are less likely to die stupidly," she said.

Alcuin considered that.

"I will take it."

Behind them, grandmother extinguished the last training brazier and locked the gate.

Tomorrow they would do it again.

No one complained.
