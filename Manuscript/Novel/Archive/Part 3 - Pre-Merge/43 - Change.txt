When Alcuin's ascension stabilized, camp went silent.

The transformation had not made him unrecognizable, but it had erased the old boundaries both factions treated as permanent. Bone structure shifted toward shared line norms. Skin tone deepened. Flame response synchronized with patterns previously labeled "city-only." 

Ksena stared at him and saw the central lie exposed in one living body.

They had never been separate species.

They had been separated by policy.

Alcuin looked at his hands in firelight.

"Say it," Ksena said softly.

He exhaled once.

"If others can do this, then your elders did not guard power. They hoarded it."

She nodded.

"And they killed to protect the monopoly."

That night no one slept much.

By dawn, shock had to become planning.

If ascension could propagate through transfer outside council control, then every village with mixed lineage became both recruitment ground and target.

Kirk rewrote priority board in blunt terms.

"Order matters," he said. "Message before rumor. Structure before panic."

They built a three-layer rollout:

1. Quiet contact with trusted village leaders.
2. Controlled demonstration with independent witnesses.
3. Written doctrine that rejected bloodline supremacy and forced ritual.

Ksena drafted the core statement with grandmother's edits and Alcuin's field language:

Ascension is inheritance, not rank.

No one owns access.

No one is forced.

No line is born above another.

It looked simple on the page and explosive in practice.

First courier left at noon with the message sewn into jacket lining and a fallback copy sealed in wax tube.

Ksena watched him disappear over dust ridge and understood a threshold had been crossed.

They were no longer only fugitives trying to survive.

They were distributing a truth the existing order could not absorb peacefully.

"How long until response?" Alcuin asked.

Kirk checked route timings.

"Fastest, three days for northern settlements. Slower where patrol density is high."

"And retaliation?"

Kirk did not soften it.

"Could begin before first confirmations return."

By evening they had contingency routes marked, emergency rendezvous points updated, and decoy packet plans in place in case original couriers were intercepted.

Grandmother reviewed the board, tapped one gap, and looked at Ksena.

"You still think this is only about exposing lies," she said. "It is also about managing what comes after people believe you."

Ksena met her gaze.

"Then we build that too."

The first reply arrived on day four.

One line, hand-carried, no signature:

If this is true, prove it where witnesses cannot be bought.

Ksena folded the note and handed it to Alcuin.

He read it once and smiled without humor.

"Good," he said. "Skepticism means they are still thinking for themselves."

Kirk packed demonstration kit before sunrise.

As they broke camp, Ksena looked east where her city's old command lines still held people in place.

Truth was moving now.

Slow, uneven, and dangerous.

But moving.

That was enough.
