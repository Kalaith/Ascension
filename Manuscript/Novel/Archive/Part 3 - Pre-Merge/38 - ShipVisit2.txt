The second visit to the human ship felt different from the first.

No ceremony. No polite tour language.

This time they were there to study a buried war.

Estele still found reasons to smile. She emerged from the guest quarters in a practical flight jacket tailored by ship crew and announced to no one in particular that humans understood fabric engineering at a spiritual level.

Ksena laughed. Alcuin pretended not to.

Kirk watched from the corridor and tried not to look too pleased by how quickly Estele had turned a military vessel into her personal fashion laboratory.

"Briefing in twelve minutes," he said. "Try to look like analysts, not celebrities."

Estele grinned. "No promises."

They met Hale in an engineering bay converted into a hybrid archive lab. Half the walls were covered by stitched satellite recon: crater chains, fused megastructures, subterranean grids, and debris signatures in near orbit.

Hale did not waste time.

"This world was not merely invaded," she said. "It was systematically regressed. Infrastructure burned, record systems targeted, recovery corridors denied."

Kirk expanded a map layer showing hidden transit tunnels below present-day settlements.

"Most current populations are living above dead cities," he said. "They inherited geography without institutions."

Ksena studied the projection with a hand braced on the table edge.

"Our collapse myths describe punishment by gods," she said. "This looks like planned attrition."

"It was," Hale replied.

She handed over a thin packet of declassified logs recovered from old beacon fragments.

Two allied species referenced in early defense records were never confirmed as extinct. No verified survivors either.

Then Kirk brought up the anomaly that had everyone in the room leaning forward.

"Intermittent encoded pings from deep strata," he said. "Not random noise. Patterned. Possibly automated. Possibly hidden communities."

Alcuin frowned. "If survivors remained underground, why never re-emerge?"

"Could be containment. Could be doctrine. Could be they don't trust surface factions," Hale said. "Could be all three."

The team spent hours correlating oral histories, ritual geography, and scan anomalies.

By late afternoon they had five candidate zones worth investigation.

None were easy.

Three sat under unstable fault shelves.

One lay inside active hostile range.

The fifth was below an old launch basin with unknown atmospheric toxins.

"So we pick between dangerous and worse," Estele said.

"Correct," Hale answered.

Before break, Hale pulled Ksena aside near the data wall.

"I need you to hear this directly," she said. "Command narrowed my engagement authority. I can continue intelligence, evacuation, and defensive logistics. Offensive support now requires tighter justification and more delay."

Ksena absorbed the constraint without visible frustration.

"Then we submit cleaner requests and tighter evidence chains," she said. "No assumptions."

Hale nodded once. "That answer is why this partnership is still possible."

On the return shuttle, silence held for most of the flight.

Below them, the landscape looked whole from altitude.

From this angle, you could almost believe history had been continuous.

But once you knew what lay under the forest and stone, every ridge looked like a scar hidden under skin.

Alcuin finally spoke as the landing skids touched down.

"I thought we were trying to end one regime," he said.

Ksena looked out at fractured plains and old city shadows.

"We are," she answered. "But we are also excavating everything that regime was built to hide."

Estele tightened her jacket and gave Kirk a sidelong look.

"And somewhere in all this," she said, "I still expect one uninterrupted day without strategy briefings."

Kirk snorted. "Schedule that after we finish rewriting civilization."

Estele smiled. "So never."

No one disagreed.
