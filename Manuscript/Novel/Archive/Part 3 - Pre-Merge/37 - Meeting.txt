The command deck sat high inside the human ship, all brushed metal, controlled light, and people moving like every second was budgeted.

Ksena and Alcuin followed Kirk through two security doors and one vertical lift that made Alcuin grip the rail until his knuckles went pale.

"Relax," Kirk said quietly.

"I am relaxed," Alcuin lied.

At the chamber entrance, two officers scanned them and stepped aside.

General Hale waited at the far end of a long table with three staff specialists and a translator unit running live semantic checks.

He rose when they entered.

"Thank you for coming aboard," he said. "I know this is not a small ask."

Ksena returned the greeting with a careful handshake, still slightly uncertain with the gesture.

Alcuin followed after watching her do it once.

Hale opened with mission parameters in plain language.

"We responded to a distress beacon routed from this world," he said. "Transit was six years. Our standing orders are peaceful contact, local coordination, and defense support where justified."

One of Ksena's accompanying council delegates stiffened at the phrase defense support.

Kirk caught it and translated intent before it could harden into accusation.

"He means conditional aid, not occupation," Kirk said.

The delegate relaxed by one degree.

Discussion moved into layered negotiation.

Humans wanted reliable incident reporting and clear command channels during crisis.

Local representatives wanted strict limits on foreign patrol movement and written non-annexation guarantees.

Terminology caused almost as much friction as policy.

When Hale said "framework," one elder heard "control architecture."

When an elder said "ancestral authority," a human analyst heard "theocratic veto."

Kirk spent half the session translating assumptions, not words.

Progress came in narrow increments.

No unilateral human patrols inside settlement zones.

Shared incident channel with dual verification.

Joint review board for external-threat intelligence release.

Dispute mechanism requiring two-party signature before force authorization.

Then came the question no one wanted but everyone needed.

"Your home is six years away," a delegate said to Hale. "What stops you from taking what you want and leaving us with procedure?"

Hale did not blink.

"Because our route stability depends on local cooperation, because our mission logs are audited by civilian oversight on Earth, and because command abuse on first contact is career-ending at minimum," he said. "Accountability is not optional for us."

No one smiled.

The delegate nodded once.

By the time the session closed, trust had not appeared.

Structure had.

That was enough for day one.

Outside the chamber, Alcuin waited near bulkhead glass with his hand resting on a knife he did not need but still carried out of habit.

Ksena came out with a signed draft packet in hand.

"Did we get anything real?" he asked.

She held up the packet.

"Not trust," she said. "Rules."

He considered that and nodded.

"Rules are a start."

Behind them, through the chamber door, human and local aides were already arguing over clause wording for the final copy.

The alliance had begun exactly where it had to.

Not with sentiment.

With constraints both sides could enforce.
