The city in the basin was not what Ksena expected.

From the ridge it looked bigger than her home and older in the places that mattered. Irrigation channels cut through dense housing. Market roofs overlapped like scales. Animal yards sat beside workshops. Nothing was decorative for long. Everything served a second purpose.

"This was never a village," Ksena said.

Alcuin shaded his eyes and studied the gate rotations.

"No," he said. "This is a city that survived by feeding itself."

They entered under temporary permit after a long checkpoint interview and equipment review. Route maps were copied. Weapons were peace-tied. Administrative access required escort.

Ksena had grown up where bloodline replaced paperwork.

Here, a clerk with ink-stained fingers and no visible fear stamped her permit and told her to keep it dry.

They were assigned an archivist named Sera who moved fast, spoke plainly, and watched them as if deciding every ten minutes whether they were scholars or trouble.

"You asked for birthplace registries," Sera said while unlocking records annex doors. "Most travelers ask for trade permits."

"We are tracing lineage splits," Ksena said.

Sera did not smile.

"Then you are tracing politics."

The records were better preserved than Ksena had hoped.

Birth ledgers by district.

Migration logs after conflict years.

Founding-family indices from coalition era.

Ksena stopped at two surnames she recognized from her own city's ruling circle.

The same lines appeared here.

"These families split," she said.

Sera leaned over the page. "Centuries ago. Some stayed with ritual authority. Some joined coalition governance."

"Why was that never taught in my city?"

Sera gave her a sharp look.

"You know why."

They spent the afternoon cross-referencing line records with oral-history shelves. One annotated transcript described latent ascendant traits appearing before formal ritual age in both city and non-city children.

That contradicted everything Ksena had been taught.

At dusk, Sera arranged a meeting with an elder from Founder's Terrace, an herbalist who still kept pre-split stories in family memory.

The old woman studied Ksena's face for a long time before speaking.

"You carry southern line structure," she said. "But your eyes are river-branch. Mixed line." 

Ksena frowned. "River-branch?"

"One of the old integration lines before pairings were restricted by council doctrine."

Alcuin watched Ksena absorb the words like a physical blow.

"You're saying her history was edited," he said.

The elder corrected him.

"Everyone's history was edited. Hers was curated."

They drank bitter tea while the elder described the split as she had received it: not tribe versus city, but governance versus monopoly. One branch centralized ritual access and information control. The other decentralized food production and civic authority at the cost of slower coordination.

Neither side was innocent.

Only one side wrote cleaner myths.

On the walk back, internal security stopped them for second-pass verification, citing "external agitation through lineage questioning."

Sera stepped between them and the patrol captain.

"They are registered archive visitors under my supervision," she said. "If you have a complaint, file it in writing."

The captain backed off with a warning.

"Ask fewer dangerous questions before you leave."

That night Ksena spread copied records across lodging floorboards.

Shared founding names.

Split line entries.

Proof that ascendant potential and governance choices had always been broader than council doctrine allowed.

"Birthplace," she said quietly. "I thought it meant one house in one city."

Alcuin sat beside her.

"Maybe it means where your story stopped being theirs," he said.

At sunrise Registrar Tolen finalized their exit paperwork and handed Ksena a sealed referral for a historian network farther north.

"If you plan to keep asking these questions," Tolen said, "you will need people who can verify your findings fast."

At the gate, Sera walked them out.

"One warning," she said. "People who control narratives do not surrender them politely."

"We noticed," Alcuin said.

Sera looked directly at Ksena.

"Then come back as neighbors, not liberators."

Ksena nodded.

"That is the only version I want."

They left by the eastern road with heavier packs and a clearer map of what had been hidden.

As the walls shrank behind them, Ksena wanted to run south and throw every copied page in front of the council.

She did not.

Evidence was not enough without timing, allies, and a way to survive the backlash.

"Camp before dark?" Alcuin asked.

"Yes," she said.

Then she tightened the waterproof wrap around the records.

"And tomorrow we keep going."
