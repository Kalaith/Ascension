Alcuin had rehearsed the speech all morning and forgot every line when he saw his village gate.

A year ago he had walked out as an exile.

Now flame moved under his skin when he breathed too hard.

The scouts recognized his face first and his ascended aura second. By the time he reached the outer posts, half the village had gathered with spears lowered and eyes fixed on him like he might be both miracle and threat.

The elder and head hunter stepped forward together.

"State your purpose," the elder said, voice formal and thin.

"To speak the truth before rumor does it badly," Alcuin answered.

The head hunter stared at his hands where faint heat shimmered over callused knuckles.

"Alcuin?" she asked.

"Yes."

Silence held.

Then the elder gestured toward his tent.

"Inside."

They sat on opposite mats while rain tapped hide roofing overhead. No one touched the tea.

Alcuin started with exile, then temple routes, then the ancient records he and Ksena had uncovered.

He did not embellish.

He explained that ascension for city-born lines had been reduced to activation by ritual, while for tribal lines it required power transfer. He explained that the crystal system in the city did more than awaken power. It enforced control. He explained what happened to villages that learned too much too quickly.

The elder listened without interrupting, but his jaw tightened at every mention of hidden history.

When Alcuin finished, the head hunter spoke first.

"If this is true, why tell us now?"

"Because two people cannot fight a system built over centuries," Alcuin said. "Because if we do nothing, they will eventually burn every village that could produce opposition."

The elder folded his hands.

"And your offer?"

"Voluntary ascension training," Alcuin said. "No coercion. No bloodline gatekeeping. No one forced."

The elder looked toward the tent flap where shadow movement showed villagers crowding close outside.

"You ask us to gamble survival on a power we were taught to fear."

"I know," Alcuin said. "If I were in your seat, I would hesitate too."

The head hunter leaned forward.

"If we refuse?"

"Then we keep sharing warning routes and evacuations," Alcuin said. "I did not come to demand obedience."

That answer shifted the room.

Not enough for trust.

Enough for negotiation.

By dusk the elder called a full council at the central fire ring. Alcuin stood before hunters, healers, elders, and apprentices while rain smoke drifted low.

He demonstrated controlled flame output only once, then put it out immediately.

"This is not a crown," he said. "It is responsibility with cost."

Questions came hard.

Would ascension erase identity?

Would children be pressured?

Could city forces detect new ascendants?

Could the process be reversed?

Alcuin answered what he knew and said "I do not know" when he did not.

That earned him more ground than any display of power.

At the end, the elder announced a provisional decision.

No mass adoption.

No public declarations.

Small volunteer cohort only, screened by village council, trained off-site, with independent observers from two neighboring tribes.

"We move slowly," the elder said. "If this power is freedom, it will survive scrutiny."

Alcuin bowed his head.

"That's fair."

When the meeting broke, old friends approached in hesitant groups. Some clasped his forearm. Some only nodded. A few avoided him entirely.

It hurt less than he expected.

On his way out, the head hunter caught him near the storage sheds.

"You changed," she said.

"Everyone does."

"Not like this."

He gave her a tired half-smile.

"I did not come back to be worshipped or forgiven. I came back because this village still matters to me."

She studied him for a long moment, then handed him a wrapped bundle.

Dried meat, water flasks, fresh bandage roll.

"For the road," she said. "Tell Ksena we are not her enemies unless she makes us so."

"She won't."

He left before dawn, running the old forest path until mist burned off and plains opened ahead.

Behind him, his village had not transformed overnight.

It had done something harder.

It had agreed to think, argue, and choose under pressure.

Alcuin decided that was enough for a first return.
