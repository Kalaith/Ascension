The first time Ksena saw a human ship up close, she forgot to breathe.

It descended through low cloud like a moving cliff, all white plating and dark seams, its underside lined with lights that swept the valley floor. Wind punched across the rocks as engines throttled down. Alcuin planted his feet and narrowed his eyes, hand already near his knife even though a blade meant nothing against something that size.

Kirk stood between them and shouted over the noise. "Stay close. Do not run when the ramp opens."

The ramp dropped with a metallic groan. Warm air spilled out, carrying oil, metal, and a sterile scent Ksena could not name. Armed guards waited inside in neat formation, helmets on, rifles lowered but ready.

Ksena stepped forward anyway.

Inside, everything moved with purpose. People in gray uniforms crossed corridors with tablets in hand. Screens glowed along bulkheads with shifting maps and technical readouts. Doors hissed open without anyone touching them. Alcuin looked at each mechanism like it might bite.

"They could have wiped us out months ago," he muttered.

"Yes," Ksena said. "They did not."

That was not trust, but it was data.

Kirk took them through security and up to command level. They met General Hale in a conference room with reinforced windows and a long steel table.

Hale rose when they entered. She looked tired, sharp-eyed, and careful with every word.

"Thank you for coming aboard," she said. "I know this is overwhelming. You are guests, not prisoners."

Ksena nodded. "Then I will answer as a guest."

Hale glanced once at Alcuin. "And you?"

"I answer after I see how your people behave," he said.

Hale accepted that without offense.

The first meeting stayed short. They covered basic terms, immediate safety, and where Ksena and Alcuin would stay while both sides prepared for formal talks. No one pretended mistrust had vanished. No one tried to force pace.

A young aide escorted them to guest quarters. The suite had two sleeping rooms linked by a shared sitting area. Clean fabric. Soft seating. Climate controls. A private wash station.

Ksena stared at the shower controls.

"Water from above?"

The aide smiled. "Temperature here, pressure here. Towels there. Call if you need anything."

When the door closed behind him, Alcuin dropped onto the couch, then cursed as he sank deeper than expected.

"This furniture is a trap."

Ksena laughed for the first time that day. "You smell like smoke and temple dust. I am using the shower first."

"I smell like travel."

"Travel smells bad."

She vanished into the washroom before he could answer.

Hot water hit her shoulders, and months of grit ran brown down the drain. She stood motionless for several minutes with her forehead against cool tile, letting the noise of engines and voices blur into a steady hum. She had been running since exile. In that room, for ten quiet minutes, she was not running.

When she emerged wrapped in a towel, Alcuin looked up and then quickly looked away, ears red.

"My clothes are drying," she said, too quickly.

"Human wardrobes are in your room," he said, still not looking.

"Then you should wash too."

He grumbled, but he went.

By the time Kirk returned, both of them were in borrowed robes and slightly embarrassed by how comfortable they looked.

Kirk leaned against the doorway and smirked. "You both clean up well. Dinner in one hour. If you want, I can show you more of the ship first."

Alcuin shook his head. "No." 

Ksena answered before Kirk finished the offer. "Yes."

Alcuin gave her a flat look. She gave him an innocent one back.

The tour stayed to non-sensitive decks: medbay corridors, a training bay, observation gallery, mess hall perimeter. Crew members watched Ksena with open curiosity and watched Alcuin with a different caution, as if trying to map his limits by posture alone.

Kirk handled the looks by keeping conversation moving.

"These are atmospheric recyclers."

"This is emergency gravity control."

"Do not touch that panel."

Ksena absorbed everything, asking precise questions. What powered the ship. How they tracked storms from orbit. Why some rooms felt warmer than others. Kirk answered what he could and flagged what required clearance.

By the time they returned to quarters, Ksena was laughing from pure sensory overload, and Alcuin was pretending not to care that she had laughed more with Kirk in one hour than she had in the last week on the road.

Dinner was held in an officer dining room, smaller than a full mess but still formal. Hale joined them with two staff analysts and kept the tone practical.

They discussed terrain choke points, city flight patterns, and supply vulnerabilities. They compared oral history with satellite scans. They reviewed what was known about Kalani and what was still assumption.

Halfway through the meal, Hale noticed Ksena had barely eaten.

"Food issue?" the general asked.

Ksena shook her head. "Since my ritual destabilized, appetite changes. My sister and mother eat less than others. I think my body is diverting energy while ascension remains incomplete."

Hale nodded and made a note. "Medical can monitor if you consent."

"Later," Ksena said.

Alcuin had no such problem. He finished two plates, then eyed a third before deciding dignity mattered more than hunger in this room.

After dinner, Kirk walked them back and stopped at the door.

"Tomorrow starts harder work," he said. "Sleep if you can."

Inside, the room went quiet. Engine vibration pulsed through floor plates like a distant heartbeat.

Alcuin sat on the couch and stared at his hands.

"You trust them?"

Ksena sat opposite him. "I trust that they have interests. We make those interests align with ours."

He looked up. "That sounded like your grandmother."

"Then maybe I listened."

He huffed a laugh.

Before lights out, Ksena stood at the small viewport and watched stars drift beyond reinforced glass. Human steel, human rules, human firepower. None of it erased what waited below.

But for the first time since exile, the fight ahead felt less like two fugitives against a world.

It felt like a coalition forming under pressure, fragile and real.
