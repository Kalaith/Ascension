Kirk noticed it before breakfast finished.

Ksena and Alcuin were avoiding eye contact with military discipline and failing badly.

Every accidental glance ended in synchronized blushing and sudden interest in completely irrelevant equipment.

Kirk set his ration tray down and tried very hard not to grin like an idiot.

"So," he said casually, "did I miss a diplomatic summit overnight, or are you two just rehearsing embarrassment as a team exercise?"

Alcuin nearly inhaled tea.

Ksena dropped her canteen cap.

Kirk gave up and laughed.

"Right. Confirmed."

For one brief stretch, camp sounded less like fugitives planning a civil collapse and more like people under thirty with functioning hearts.

Then strategy pulled them back.

Kalani remained active, unpredictable, and extremely lethal.

Personal distraction was not harmless in that context.

Kirk killed the humor first.

"We move before noon," he said, spreading route maps between them. "Ridge weather shifts by afternoon. If we miss this corridor, next safe window is tomorrow and we do not have tomorrow."

Alcuin nodded, recovering.

Ksena did too, though her ears were still red.

They worked through transit sequence, relay points, and fallback markers in clipped sentences until the mood settled into focus.

Halfway through gear check, Alcuin walked directly into a bulkhead while looking at Ksena.

Kirk made a noise that was somewhere between a cough and a laugh.

"Operational note," he said. "Eyes on terrain, not each other, unless you want to die in a hallway before the enemy does anything useful."

Ksena pressed her lips together to keep from smiling.

Alcuin pretended the wall had moved.

By departure, teasing had burned off and discipline was back in place.

Kirk took point through first canyon leg.

Alcuin ran rear security.

Ksena held center with comm slate and route timing.

For two hours they moved in professional silence broken only by hand signals and short status calls.

At the second ridge halt, Kirk looked back and caught them exchanging one quick glance that said more than any confession.

He let it pass.

People needed something to fight for that was not only vengeance.

At dusk they made temporary camp in a hollow shielded from wind and line-of-sight scans.

Kirk checked perimeter beacons while Ksena and Alcuin built cook fire under low flame discipline.

No jokes this time.

Just efficient movement and shared rhythm.

Later, while logging route notes, Kirk wrote one line in the margin for himself:

They are becoming a team with emotional gravity. Useful if managed. Dangerous if exploited.

He closed the slate and looked toward the small fire where Ksena and Alcuin sat shoulder to shoulder in quiet conversation.

For tonight, at least, their closeness made them steadier, not weaker.

Tomorrow would test whether that held under real pressure.
