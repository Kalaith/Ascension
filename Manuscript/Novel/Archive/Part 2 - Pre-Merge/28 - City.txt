The city rose out of the plains like a practical answer to an old catastrophe.

Ksena stopped on the ridge and stared.

Its architecture carried echoes of her home but none of her city's vanity. Towers were broad and load-bearing, not ornamental. Gardens were terraced food systems, not decorative courts. Streets were designed for carts and foot traffic, not ceremonial procession.

Alcuin followed her gaze.

"This place expects famine, not applause," he said.

Ksena nodded.

"Mine expects obedience."

At the gate, guards crossed spears until screening protocols were complete.

"Names, origin, purpose," the lead guard said.

Alcuin answered first.

"Travelers requesting temporary permit for supplies and archive inquiry."

The guard's eyes moved to Ksena.

"Ascendant?"

"Exiled ascendant," she said.

A younger guard muttered a curse under his breath. The lead did not react.

"No open flame inside market quarter. No flight within walls. Weapons peace-tied. Violations end permit." he said.

"Understood," Alcuin replied.

They were assigned a one-day movement pass and a municipal guide named Ressa, who looked like she had done this for too long and trusted no one's first version of anything.

"You get market, lodging, and supervised records request," she said while leading them through checkpoint lanes. "You do not get military district, water command, or old council vaults."

"Why so strict?" Ksena asked.

"Because strict survived our last civil fracture," Ressa said.

Inside the walls, city life ran loud and unscripted.

Public kitchens fed labor shifts by token.

Toolsmiths argued prices with irrigation crews.

Children carried message slates between craft rows.

Two traders shouted over grain tariffs and then laughed five minutes later while unloading the same cart.

No one asked permission to breathe.

Ksena felt the difference in her chest before she had words for it.

Ressa lodged them in a narrow room above a baker's shop and arranged an evening appointment with civic historian Halven after Alcuin traded two worked pelts for expedited access.

Halven's archive smelled like dust, oil, and old ink.

He listened while Ksena described temple records, split traditions, and barriers used as political instruments. He interrupted only to request date anchors and route references.

When she finished, he opened a ledger that had been rebound so many times the spine looked like layered bark.

"Your two cities share founders," he said. "They diverged after the war over one question: whether ascension should be governed by distributed councils or controlled by a single ritual authority."

Ksena swallowed.

"My city teaches that alternative models collapsed on their own."

"Convenient history," Halven said.

He slid over three copied maps marked with old temple clusters, post-war migration lanes, and restricted heat-fracture zones.

"Take these," he said. "And do not cross glass plains at high sun unless you enjoy losing skin."

On the way out, Ressa gave Ksena a long, measuring look.

"You came here expecting simple answers," she said.

Ksena shook her head.

"I came expecting to be denied entry."

"That would have been easier for everyone."

"Including you?"

Ressa snorted. "Especially me."

Night fell hard while they reviewed notes in their lodging room.

Alcuin spread maps on the floorboards.

"We have updated routes, record confirmation, and one contact letter for the northern district," he said. "That's progress."

Ksena sat by the window and watched lantern lines move through streets that functioned without barriers or ritual control.

"It's also proof," she said. "Another model survived."

At dawn they renewed permit long enough to depart through east gate.

Ressa met them at checkpoint and handed Ksena a sealed slip.

"Show this if northern wardens stop you," she said. "It confirms you are approved researchers, not reconnaissance assets."

Ksena accepted it with both hands.

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. Bring back evidence worth the paperwork."

They stepped out into open country before midday.

Behind them the gate cycled for the next caravan, ordinary as weather.

Ksena looked back once.

"One day," she said, "I want my city to run on agreements instead of fear."

Alcuin adjusted his pack and kept walking.

"Then we stay alive long enough to make fear expensive," he said.

She followed.

For the first time since exile, she carried not only anger but a working blueprint.
