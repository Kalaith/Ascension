Alcuin felt the watcher long before he found proof.

It was the pressure between shoulder blades that never quite left, the way birds lifted too early from brush, the scrape of weight where no wind moved. Whoever tracked them knew how to mask a trail almost as well as he did.

Ksena noticed his silence by midday.

"Are you all right?" she asked as they crossed the dry flats.

"Headache," he said.

It was a lie, but not a complete one.

He did not tell her about the follower yet. If he was wrong, he would only feed fear. If he was right, he needed one clean read before he acted.

"The next temple should be near this ridge line," Ksena said, checking a charcoal mark on her map strip. "You can wait outside if you want."

He glanced at her and shook his head. "I am coming in."

She smiled, relieved.

Behind a basalt outcrop, Maera flattened herself against stone and held her breath until they moved on.

Of course he had heard something, she thought. Trust Alcuin to hear cloth on rock from thirty paces.

She had returned from hunting to find him gone, exiled with the city girl everyone blamed and nobody understood. Maera had argued with elders, with family, with anyone who tried to stop her. Then she had packed and followed.

Now she watched him carry half the load while the ascendant walked beside him like she belonged there.

Maera hated the thought enough to taste iron.

She kept moving.

Alcuin found the first sign by late afternoon: a carved notch on deadwood at knee height. Not random. Deliberate. Someone wanted him to know he was being followed.

He showed no reaction and kept walking.

By sunset they saw smoke on the horizon.

Alcuin's pace changed first, then turned into a run.

Ksena chased him through scrub and loose stone, lungs burning.

They reached the village as light failed.

There was nothing left worth calling a village.

Timber frames had collapsed into black ribs. The central well had caved in. Bones lay in patterns that made clear this had happened fast and with heat no normal fire could produce. Even now, one half-buried wood store still smoldered.

Ksena bent over, hands on knees, trying to pull breath back into her chest.

"Survivors?" she asked.

Alcuin looked once around the perimeter and shook his head.

"At least a week old," he said. "Maybe more."

He knelt in the ash and whispered a short hunter prayer he had not spoken since childhood.

Ksena stood beside him and added her own words, quieter, uncertain, but sincere.

When they rose, both of them looked older.

"We should move," Alcuin said. "If anyone sees us here, they could blame you before asking questions."

Ksena nodded.

Above the ruins, on a ridge line, Maera watched with clenched hands.

If this was city work, she told herself, then the ascendant had brought death with her. If it was not, then something worse was moving across territory she barely knew.

Either way, Alcuin had to be pulled clear.

After dark she left two more signs where only he would notice: directional scratches and a mark for safe camp near water.

Alcuin saw both.

He said nothing to Ksena.

They made camp by a narrow river bend before full dark. It was early to stop, but the site was defensible and gave him options.

When the fire took, he pulled on his hunting harness.

"I am going to bring back game," he said. "Stay by the fire. Do not wander."

Ksena studied him for a beat too long.

"All right," she said. "Be careful."

After he left, she sat alone with the hiss of river water and the memory of burned roofs. Eventually she forced herself to move, filled a pot, and set it over coals.

If he came back empty-handed, at least they would have hot water and something warm in their hands.

In the dark beyond camp, Alcuin followed Maera's final marker toward a stand of thorn trees and stopped where the shadows deepened.

"Come out," he said.

No answer.

Then a shape moved between trunks.

Maera stepped into weak firelight from his hand-flame, jaw set, eyes sharp with relief and anger.

"You look terrible," she said.

"So do you," he replied.

For a moment neither spoke.

Then she pointed back toward camp.

"That girl is going to get you killed."

Alcuin's expression hardened.

"And if I leave her, she dies faster."

Maera opened her mouth to argue, then stopped when she saw he had already chosen.

"A village burned east of here," she said instead. "Not by raiders. Too hot. Too clean. I thought you should know before you walk into the next one."

Alcuin nodded once.

"Thank you."

Maera gave a bitter laugh.

"Do not thank me yet. I am still deciding whether to drag you home by force."

He almost smiled, then didn't.

"I cannot go home. Not now."

She looked away first.

When they separated, no promises were made.

Alcuin returned to camp with two small river fowl and a heavier silence than when he left.

Ksena looked up from the pot as he entered firelight.

"You took longer than usual," she said.

"Bad luck on the trail," he answered.

Another half-truth.

She accepted it for now.

They ate in near silence, the village smoke still lodged in both their minds, while somewhere out beyond the firelight three separate loyalties tracked the same path toward the temple.
