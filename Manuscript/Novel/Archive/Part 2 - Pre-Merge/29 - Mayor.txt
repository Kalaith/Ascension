When the guard said one of the visitors was ascendant, Mayor Mathieu almost canceled the meeting.

When the guard added that the group also included an unknown outsider and a local male, he changed his mind.

Unusual groups carried leverage.

He met them in the council chamber with hospitality arranged and exit routes quietly secured.

"Welcome," he said, hands open. "I am Mayor Mathieu."

Ksena answered first.

"Thank you for receiving us."

She introduced Alcuin, then Kirk, the human scout.

Mathieu's expression did not change, but his aides took notes faster.

Once guards withdrew to corridor distance, he asked the only question that mattered.

"Why are you here?"

Ksena did not hide exile status.

"I failed a ritual in my city and was expelled. We are tracking temple records and old governance splits."

Kirk leaned in when prompted.

"My expedition responded to a distress beacon traced to this region. The signal referenced external hostile contact. We need source access and archive correlation."

Mathieu sat back.

"We did not transmit any recent distress call," he said. "But there is a sealed municipal chamber containing old beacon equipment. It has remained inaccessible for years."

Kirk's focus sharpened.

"Locked how?"

"Legacy seal keyed to ascendant signature," Mathieu said, eyes flicking to Ksena. "Or so records claim."

He offered rest, food, and a guided visit at first light.

Kirk wanted to push immediately. Ksena accepted delay.

Later, with only the three of them in guest quarters, Alcuin said what all three were thinking.

"He is helpful because he wants something."

Ksena nodded.

"So do we."

The next morning Mathieu escorted them through lower civic corridors beneath administrative district. The sealed chamber sat behind reinforced stone doors etched with obsolete municipal marks.

"If the lock opens," Mathieu said, "we all learn something. If it doesn't, we lose one morning and keep our assumptions."

Ksena placed her hand on the plate.

Heat spread through the old mechanism.

The seal released with a dry metallic click.

Inside, dust lay thick over console racks and signal arrays long disconnected from city grid. Kirk moved carefully through equipment rows, photographing, tagging, and restoring power cell by cell.

"Someone kept this system maintained intermittently," he said after checking wear patterns. "Not active, but not abandoned."

Mathieu frowned.

"By whom?"

"Good question," Kirk said.

They recovered a partial outbound log stack and one routing map fragment pointing toward uplink relays outside current municipal boundaries.

That made the room much more dangerous.

By midday, the chamber was locked again and data copies secured under dual custody.

Mathieu requested full file transfer.

Ksena refused full release and offered a narrow extract under witness protocol.

The mayor's tone cooled.

"You ask access in my city and then restrict municipal review."

Ksena met his gaze.

"We share verifiable findings. We do not hand over raw strategic data while chain-of-command risk is unknown."

Negotiation tightened for an hour.

Final terms were signed anyway.

Joint review panel.

Limited archive release.

Three-day research permit extension with movement restrictions.

When they left chamber level, Mathieu stopped beside the stairwell.

"You are not naive," he said to Ksena.

"Neither are you," she replied.

He gave a thin smile.

"Good. Naive people do not survive this phase."

That evening in lodging, Kirk decrypted part of the recovered index and found what he had hoped and feared.

"Relay chain extends beyond known city grids," he said. "Whoever maintained beacon infrastructure planned for delayed recipients."

Alcuin rolled the map fragment flat.

"Meaning this was never one desperate signal. It was a network."

Ksena looked at the signed municipal terms on the table.

"Then we need this mayor cooperative for now," she said. "And watched."

At departure, Mathieu handed them a sealed travel writ for northern checkpoints.

"For smoother transit," he said.

Ksena accepted it.

"For mutual utility," she answered.

He laughed once.

"Exactly."

They left the city with usable data, a conditional partner, and one confirmed truth: old distress systems were still active by design, and whoever controlled the remaining nodes could steer the next war before most people even understood it had started.
