The barrier was gone.

Morning light reached the city without distortion for the first time in generations, exposing blackened towers, collapsed markets, and districts that looked suddenly older than memory.

Ksena stood on upper terrace with one hand over her abdomen, feeling the city breathe through shock.

Alcuin joined her and settled an arm at her waist.

"Do you think the child will be all right?" he asked.

"Yes," Ksena said. "We are different in appearance, not in worth. She will be ours, and she will have a choice."

Below them, crews moved through rubble while runners carried directives district to district. The old command structure had died with the crystal. What replaced it had to be built quickly and in public.

Kirk arrived with Estele before noon, both carrying departure manifests and unfinished handover reports.

"Human command is preparing outbound transmission," Kirk said. "Some crews are overdue to rotate home."

"Already?"

"Six years outbound," he said. "People are holding together, but home still matters."

Ksena looked at Estele.

"And you?"

Estele straightened.

"I requested envoy status. If approved, I travel as representative between your council and Earth."

Ksena smiled despite exhaustion.

"Then I cannot think of a better first envoy."

In a half-repaired hall that afternoon, they reviewed next-phase priorities: civilian stabilization, ritual law reform, district autonomy protocols, and first-contact governance.

No one used the word victory.

When the meeting ended, Alcuin rubbed ash from his palms.

"After this," he said, "I need one month with no alarms, no councils, and no one trying to kill us."

Kirk laughed.

"That sounds like a classified luxury package."

"I am serious."

"So am I."

By evening, launch operations were visible from western field. Human shuttles cycled cargo, medical stores, and archive copies. Kirk delayed departure one final day to complete communications handover and emergency relay discipline.

At launch perimeter, he clasped Alcuin's forearm and turned to Ksena.

"When we arrived, you asked for rescue," he said. "Now you are negotiating terms. Earth can work with that."

Ksena nodded.

"Then we build something worth negotiating with."

The shuttle lifted at dusk. Estele stood beside Kirk in envoy colors, hand to viewport as craft climbed.

Ksena watched until lights vanished into cloud.

Silence settled over the field.

Alcuin shifted closer.

"One day at a time?"

Ksena looked over the city, then down at her hand over new life.

"One honest day at a time."

At first light she began district rounds.

In each square she delivered the same message without softening it: the barrier had protected them, and it had imprisoned them under edited history. Some crowds met her with relief. Others with anger. A few turned their backs and walked away.

She let them.

Trust was not a decree.

At night she returned to maps, casualty tables, and reform drafts until her eyes blurred. Alcuin came back from outer corridors with road reports and witness lists. They stopped speaking about winning and started speaking about systems that could survive bad leaders.

Sleep arrived in practical fragments.

Rebuilding had begun before ash settled.

Now it had terms.
