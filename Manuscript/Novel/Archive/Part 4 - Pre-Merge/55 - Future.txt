Ktira hated school.

Not because she could not do the work.

Because she could not sit still while daylight was wasting outside.

Classroom windows faced scrub hills and old hunting trails. She watched dust move over ridge while instructor filled board with war dates that ended before she was born.

Her leg bounced under desk.

If her parents let her choose, she would spend morning tracking hornback through dry ravines with Katesh at her side.

Instead she copied treaty clauses.

When final bell sounded, she was out the door before half the class packed.

She hit home at a run, changed into hunting gear, and reached for her pack.

"Ktira," her mother called from downstairs in the tone that meant no debate. "Before you vanish, take Katesh. He needs range time."

Ktira leaned over rail.

"That is not a chore. That is a reward."

Her mother gave her a look that said she was not fooled.

"Back before dinner."

"Yes, Mom."

Katesh padded beside her through scrubline, tail flicking sparks that died in dry grass. Air smelled like stone and rain that might arrive tomorrow.

They picked up hornback sign near broken culvert and followed it north.

Halfway to ridge, Katesh froze and growled low.

Ktira dropped to one knee and listened.

Voices.

Not hunters.

Patrol cadence.

She crawled to ridge lip and looked down into service road. Three city officials argued with two village wardens over training quotas, school attendance, and controlled ascension modules.

Even out here, school found her.

"If you want children to stay," one warden said, "teach what keeps them alive before next crisis."

The official answered, "If we want no return to crystal rule, they learn history as well as combat."

Ktira rolled onto her back, annoyed and unwillingly thoughtful.

She wanted hunts, not lectures.

But she had watched enough adults fail to know ignorance had a body count.

Katesh nudged her shoulder.

"Fine," she whispered. "We hunt now. We argue with teachers tomorrow."

They took hornback clean before dark.

At home, her father inspected cuts with obvious pride and hid it behind criticism about blade angle. Her mother checked for strain injuries while pretending not to smile.

Ktira ate fast and ignored council logistics at table.

Next morning she almost pretended to be sick.

Almost.

At breakfast, her father slid folded schedule across table.

"Pass this term and I sign you for advanced tracking with ranger corps."

Ktira narrowed her eyes.

"That is bribery."

"That is parenting," he said.

Her mother added, "Grades drop, field clearance freezes. We are not negotiating this every week."

School felt different after that.

In civic law they compared new charter to old crystal edicts and marked where power had hidden behind sacred language. In history they analyzed conflicting battle accounts and justified which sources they trusted.

Ktira raised her hand before she could stop herself.

"None are complete," she said. "Writers always want something."

Instructor nodded once.

"Good. Start there."

At training block they rotated through map reading, signal discipline, trauma response, and controlled ascent drills under strict output caps. City-born students were cleaner on formal sequence. Tribal students were faster under pressure. By week three they were stealing each other's techniques instead of mocking each other's origins.

Ktira still complained.

But less.

Rin caught her on south wall after class.

"So, school still useless?"

Ktira watched cargo lifts moving stone and grain through rebuilt lanes.

"Sitting still is useless," she said. "Learning is useful."

"Most Ktira answer possible," Rin said.

Two days later, Ktira got first supervised ranger assignment: missing livestock near old canal sectors. Observe and report only. No hero choices.

She moved with three trainees through wet reeds, reading prints and ash traces the way Alcuin taught her.

They found thieves by dusk.

Not raiders.

Displaced families from anti-ascendant quarter whose supply line had collapsed.

Hungry, armed, and one bad encounter away from becoming enemy faction.

Ktira wanted to step out and solve it fast.

Training overruled instinct.

She signaled withdraw, logged coordinates, and called mediation support.

By nightfall, wardens and aid couriers reached camp with ration transfers and relocation terms.

No bloodshed.

No revenge spiral.

On walk back, Rin glanced sideways.

"Old Ktira would have charged in."

"Old Ktira was reckless," Ktira said.

"New Ktira?"

She looked toward city lights and rebuilt towers.

"Still reckless," she said. "Just better aimed."

That night rain tapped roof tile while Ktira finished homework before anyone asked. She took Katesh outside and sat under awning, watching her mother on upper terrace finishing late meeting with teachers, wardens, and two village delegates.

They argued, rewrote terms, argued again, then signed.

No one looked happy.

Everyone looked committed.

Ktira scratched Katesh behind ears and watched signatures dry.

"Maybe this is hunting too," she murmured.

Not chasing prey through brush.

Tracking consequences before they turn into war.

Tomorrow she would still complain about school. She would still run for wilds whenever she could.

But she understood now why her parents refused to let her choose only one kind of strength.

The future needed both.
