Ksena's father had spent centuries preparing for invasion.

What he had not prepared for was defiance from his own blood.

He paced the command hall while reports stacked faster than aides could sort them. Barrier disturbances. Missing ritual assets. Uncontrolled ascendant signatures in outer districts. Human support moving from observation to active coordination.

He saw no complexity in any of it. He saw betrayal.

When the elders assembled, he stood beneath the war map and gave orders without pause.

"Containment is over," he said. "We move to full suppression."

No one challenged him. Some could not. Others no longer remembered how.

"Primary strike group engages the human vessel and denies aerial support. Secondary units clear resistance cells in tribal corridors. Internal command teams secure ritual assets and detain defectors."

He turned to Ksena's mother in the final row.

"You hold the access route to my residence. No one enters. No exceptions."

"Yes," she answered, voice flat.

He dismissed the chamber and watched them move as one body. Efficient. Obedient. Hollow.

Outside, sirens rose.

Human distraction fire struck the northern shield arc, not enough to breach, enough to force response.

He smiled without warmth.

"Predictable."

What he did not see was movement beneath his own command layer.

In the east quarter, grandmother reopened sealed maintenance tunnels and began moving civilians out in staggered columns. In lower terraces, Alcuin organized mixed teams and cleared streets before formal battle lines reached residential blocks.

At the inner gate, Ksena arrived with grandmother and met the one obstacle she had feared most.

Her mother.

The first fireball came fast and low. Ksena flinched. Grandmother snapped up a shield and split the strike across two pillars.

"Focus," grandmother barked. "She is bound."

Ksena stared at her mother, at perfect combat form under crystal conditioning, at a tiny tremor in her left hand that looked almost like resistance.

"I don't want to fight her."

"Then fight for her," grandmother said. "Go."

Ksena hesitated one heartbeat too long. Her mother launched again. Ksena rolled clear and forced distance.

Grandmother stepped into the lane and engaged, flame against flame, old discipline against old control.

"Finish this," she said through clenched teeth.

Ksena looked once at her mother.

For a fraction of a second, her mother met her eyes and gave a small, broken smile. Permission through a crack.

Ksena turned and flew for the ritual district.

Behind her, the city fractured into simultaneous battles.

Controlled veterans held formal lines around strategic nodes.

Newly freed ascendants fought in uneven clusters, uncertain but determined.

Human teams stayed to evacuation and suppression, pulling civilians from collapse zones while avoiding occupation posture.

Alcuin held the east corridor long enough for the last family convoy to clear.

He looked toward the ritual tower as light began to pulse from inside.

"Come back," he said under his breath.

In the tower antechamber, Ksena paused with one hand on scorched stone.

Rage pressed against her ribs like a second pulse.

She let it pass.

If she entered angry, she would die angry.

She entered steady.

Beyond the threshold, her father's power rolled through the chamber in measured waves, shaping heat, narrowing lanes, turning architecture into a weapon.

He had expected her.

Good, Ksena thought.

So had she.
