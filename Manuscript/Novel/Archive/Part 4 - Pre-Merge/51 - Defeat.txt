Kalani burned like a second sun over the city.

"They are here!" she screamed, laughing while unstable flame poured off her skin.

Ksena rose toward her with one hand raised. "Kalani, stop. We fight together or we die separately."

"I do not share victories," Kalani said. "I erase enemies."

She climbed higher, drawing power so fast the air seemed to tear around her. Below, people threw themselves behind broken walls.

"Kalani!" Ksena shouted. "You are overloading."

Kalani answered with a condensed sphere of white fire hurled at the incoming fleet.

The blast shook the valley. Pressure rolled over rooftops. Ksena threw a barrier broad enough to shield the nearest streets and held it while heat slammed her guard.

For a heartbeat the world was only noise and light.

Then the glare thinned.

Three enemy capitals were scorched but intact, defensive lattices rippling as they corrected formation.

Kalani hovered above the smoke, swaying.

"See?" she gasped. "Strongest."

A narrow beam lanced from the flagship and punched through her chest.

Ksena was in the air before she thought. She caught her sister before impact. Blood soaked both arms instantly.

Kalani's eyes found hers for one clear second.

"I wanted... to be more than a weapon."

Then her hand slackened.

Ksena lowered her to stone and stayed there, bent over her, breath breaking.

Alcuin knelt beside them and closed Kalani's eyes.

No one spoke.

Before sunset, Kirk and Estele returned from outer observation with hard numbers.

"Three capitals damaged, none destroyed," Kirk said. "Their shield harmonics absorbed most of it. They are repositioning for precision passes."

Ksena wiped her face and stood.

"Then we stop giving them precision."

That night they rebuilt defense under active threat.

Grandmother split civilians into mobile shelter cells and reopened maintenance corridors. Alcuin took southern evacuation lanes and assigned runners block by block. Estele deployed false heat clusters and decoy ascent signatures in abandoned sectors. Kirk pushed encrypted requests for orbital pattern analysis and beam-cycle timing.

By first watch, the city no longer behaved like a single target.

By second watch, the first probe strike hit an empty decoy quarter.

"They are mapping response lag," Estele said from signal platform.

"Then we feed them bad maps," Ksena answered.

They reorganized defense into autonomous cells with local authority and fixed retreat logic. If one cell failed, the rest kept operating.

At noon, delayed human telemetry arrived.

Enemy beam systems required short line lock before discharge.

"Break lock in that window and the shot drifts," Kirk said.

Ksena looked up from the timing strip.

"Smoke layers, thermal noise, moving decoys, staggered signatures. No static heroes. No clear center."

No one argued.

When the next beam cycle formed, Kirk called countdown over channel.

"Lock forming. Twelve seconds."

Ksena drove a thermal surge across eastern quarter. Alcuin triggered three false signatures on delay. Estele dropped blackout screens between ridge towers.

The beam fired wide and carved a molten trench beyond the walls.

Cheering broke out from shelter corridors before command could quiet it. Fear remained, but now it had shape and response.

That night Ksena went alone to the memorial stones in old fountain court.

Kalani's name was cut first.

Not because she had been innocent.

Because she had been family.

Ksena touched the carved letters with soot-stained fingers.

"I am angry with you," she said softly. "I miss you anyway."

Alcuin stopped at her shoulder and waited until she stood.

"Kirk says we can hold two more days before modulation stock runs out."

"Then two days is enough," Ksena said.

At 03:20, enemy transports attempted low insertion over northern rim. They met crossfire from mixed teams that had trained together for weeks and fought like they had trained for years.

Two transports aborted. One crashed in dry basin. The fourth escaped without deploying troops.

By dawn, casualty projections dropped below first-day worst case for the first time since contact.

Kirk looked up from the board.

"This is working."

Ksena watched the horizon through a broken roofline.

"Good," she said. "Now we survive tomorrow."
