The night before the ritual, Ksena was kept in a preparation chamber with two attendants and no windows. They brushed her hair, tied ceremonial bands around her wrists, and spoke in the same careful tone people used near unstable fire.

"Keep your breathing even," one said.

"Do not remove your hands until instructed," said the other.

"Do not speak unless asked."

She nodded through all of it, though her mind kept drifting to the village and Alcuin's good luck chant.

At dawn they led her through a narrow corridor into the ritual hall.

It was larger than she remembered from watching Kalani's ceremony. Maybe fear made spaces bigger.

Her father stood by the crystal with the elders in a ring. Her mother and sister waited behind them in full flame dress, not close enough to touch.

She wanted to run to them anyway.

Instead she followed the marks on the floor and knelt where instructed.

The crystal looked ordinary from a distance. Up close it seemed to pull light inward.

"Candidate Ksena," her father intoned, "state your name and pledge."

She did.

"Approach."

She rose, stepped forward, and placed both palms on the stone.

The first sensation was heat. The second was pressure behind her eyes. The third was impossible speed: images tearing through her mind faster than thought.

Cities she had never seen. Skies split by fire. Creatures in armor unlike anything in city records. Ascendants fighting shoulder to shoulder with tribe warriors. Then those same groups divided, shouting, turning on each other.

The images did not stop.

She tried to breathe and nearly choked.

Somewhere far away she heard the ritual master call for alignment. Another voice shouted correction. Someone said hold her. Someone else said no.

Then she was on the floor with her hands ripped free and a taste of blood in her mouth where she'd bitten her lip.

When she forced her eyes open, there were no flames around her body.

Only silence.

Then her mother's command: "Seize her."

The guards dragged her before she could understand what had happened.

As they pulled her away, Ksena saw Kalani start forward, stopped by a hand at her shoulder. Kalani's face looked stricken, then blank.

The blankness hurt most.

In confinement, hours blurred. She woke, slept, woke again. The images kept returning whenever she closed her eyes.

When her father finally appeared, she asked him what she had done wrong.

He asked only one question in return.

"Why did you resist?"

"I didn't mean to."

"Meaning is irrelevant. Outcome is not."

She asked if she could retry the ritual.

"No," he said. "The crystal is not to be stressed again."

She asked for her mother.

"Denied."

She asked for Kalani.

"Denied."

He turned to leave, then paused at the door.

"You are no longer protected by status," he said. "Remember that."

After he left, Ksena curled on the narrow bed and repeated one thought until it felt like an anchor.

I did not fail by choice.

By the next morning that thought was all she had.
