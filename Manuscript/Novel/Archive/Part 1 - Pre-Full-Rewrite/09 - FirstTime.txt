Alcuin finished setting up the fire and putting some fresh animal to be cooked, the tribe had been generous they didn't want him to leave, but if they had to they gave him everything he needed to start, Ksena sat near the fire, brooding eyes reflected the firelight, Alcuin doubted he could forgive her completely for getting him banished from the tribe, but maybe it was the rituals fault he casts and Alcuin thought to himself if Ksena had been exiled and he wasn't, he would have likely have gone with her anyway, but it would have been nice if it was his choice.

Alcuin turned over the food. While he wasn't the best cook in the world, and nothing like the food Ksena would eat in her home, he considered himself at least decent. He hadn't died from his own cooking, at least.

"Do you want to talk?" He asked Ksena, who just shrugged and turned around and laid down facing away from him and the fire.

Alcuin poked the fire harder than he meant to, the fire pop making them both jump

"I'm sorry for what I said, I know you didn't ask to banish me, it's just so sudden and no one has explained anything on why I or you should have been exiled from our homes", Alcuin heard a sniffle come from Ksena direction but her face still hidden facing away from him.

Taking his dinner from the fire, Alcuin separate some out for Ksena and quickly ate his, washing it down with a few gulps of water

"I am going to go for a walk. Don't go far from the fire okay, I know you have never been past our village, but there are things out here you don't want to run into. I'll be back in an hour."

Ksena nodded, but otherwise didn't move to face him

"Your foods here when you want it, be back soon" not waiting for her to acknowledge, he grabbed his hunting equipment and set off. He didn't actually expect to find anything, but he didn't think he could stay around her right now.

Ksena waited until she couldn't hear Alcuin's footprints anymore before getting up, the food looked good and although she wasn't that hungry she slowly dug into it, she wasn't used to such a savage way of eating, treat maybe her kind smile before her somber mode took over, she ended up eating more of it than she expected but it had been a long day, she also felt bad by how she treated Alcuin he didn't have to help her, and without him she would be lost, finally having a sip of water before getting more comfortable in front of the fire and settling into a light sleep

Alcuin arrived back at camp. He had actually caught a replacement for their dinner tonight, at least another day's supplies. He smiled as he noticed Ksena had eaten most of the food he prepared for her; he settled down near the fire and used the remaining bits of dinner to have for lunch tomorrow and preparing his fresh catch. It would likely be tomorrow's dinner.

After it was all done, he banked the fire, and laid down opposite Ksena and fell asleep

The first morning after exile felt wrong in every way. The sky was too wide. The ground did not echo city footsteps. there were no bells telling her where to stand.

Only wind.

Ksena sat near the fire with her knees pulled close while Alcuin checked their packs for the third time.

"We move at first light," he said.

"We've been moving for days," she replied.

"Now we move with purpose."

He spread a rough map scratch in the dirt and marked their position with a twig.

"Nearest settlement is here. If we can get supply trade, we go north toward the old ruin line."

"And if they refuse us?"

"Then we hunt and keep walking."

She nodded, pretending that sounded simple.

The path north took them through low scrub and broken stone. Around midday they found old tracks cut deep into the ground, not from animals. Cart wheels, multiple passes, recently dried after rain.

"Trade route," Alcuin said. "Good sign."

"Or bad sign."

"Same thing out here."

By late afternoon they reached a small traveler outpost built around a we'll and three permanent cook pits. A dozen people occupied the place: traders, hunters, one family with two children, and a pair of men who looked like hired muscle.

Conversations thinned as Ksena and Alcuin approached.

A man at the we'll lifted his chin. "Passing through or asking to stay?"

"Passing," Alcuin said. "Need water and directions to old stone sites."

"Old stones are cursed," someone muttered.

"Everything is cursed if you're weak," another replied.

Ksena stepped forward before Alcuin could stop her. "Do you know the route?"

The we'll man studied her face too long.

"You look city-born."

"I was."

"We're."

"Yes."

He spat into the dust. "Then you're either lying or trouble."

"Could be both," Alcuin said dryly. "Still need water."

A few people laughed, tension easing by a fraction.

The we'll man jerked his head toward a woman at the cook pit. "Ask Mara. She knows old roads. If she likes your face."

Mara did not look up when they approached.

"What do you want?" she asked, stirring stew.

"Direction to ancient stone sites," Alcuin said.

"For worship or looting?"

"Neither."

"Then why?"

Ksena answered before she could talk herself out of it. "Because my ritual failed and I need answers."

Mara finally looked up.

"Failed?"

"Yes."

The cook pit went quiet.

Mara's expression changed from suspicion to sharp interest. "Sit."

They sat.

Mara asked questions while pretending not to. Where was the ritual done. Who witnessed it. What happened to her afterward. Ksena answered only what felt safe.

When she finished, Mara took a long breath.

"You need someone who's been close to those places before," she said. "Not maps. Not rumors. A guide."

"Know one?" Alcuin asked.

Mara lifted her spoon and pointed across the outpost.

At the far table sat a young woman with dark braids, a hunting bow across her knees, and eyes that missed nothing.

"Estele," Mara said. "Best tracker in this region. Also the most expensive."

"Can she be trusted?" Alcuin asked.

Mara barked a laugh. "No one can be trusted. She can be paid. That's close enough."

They approached Estele at dusk.

She watched them come like she had expected it.

"You're the exile pair," she said. "I heard."

"We need a guide," Ksena said.

Estele's gaze moved between them and settled on Alcuin for half a beat too long.

"You need more than a guide," she said. "You need someone who can keep you alive when you make bad decisions."

"That sounds expensive," Alcuin said.

"It is."

Ksena opened her pack and placed two small jewel pieces on the table. "Advance. More on arrival."

Estele picked one up, tested its weight, then set it down.

"Where's arrival?"

Ksena drew the map line with her finger.

Estele raised an eyebrow. "You're aiming for restricted ruins and old war corridors."

"Yes."

"People disappear there."

"We disappear here if we do nothing," Ksena said.

Estele smiled at that. Not kindly, but approvingly.

"Fine," she said. "Terms. I set pace. I set camp location. You follow orders fast in danger. No heroics unless I call it."

"Agreed," Ksena said.

Alcuin hesitated, then nodded. "Agreed."

Estele leaned back. "We leave at first light. Sleep while you can."

That night, Ksena lay awake beneath the outpost shelter and listened to travelers trade stories in low voices. Two men argued about raider routes. A mother hummed a child to sleep. Somewhere close, Estele laughed softly at something Alcuin said, and Ksena hated herself for noticing.

At dawn, Estele was already packed and waiting.

"Show me your gear," she said.

She tore through their packs with ruthless efficiency.

"Too much cloth. Not enough cord. Why are you carrying three bowls?"

"Because we need bowls," Ksena said.

"You need one bowl and better feet."

She redistributed weight, stripped nonessential items, and added two small traps from her own kit.

"You move like city people," she said to Ksena. "You'll fix that."

To Alcuin she said, "You move like a hunter. Good. Keep her from dying while I keep both of you from getting lost."

The first leg with Estele felt faster and more dangerous at the same time. She used terrain like language, reading broken grasses, bird silence, and wind direction as if the land spoke to her.

At midday she halted them beneath an outcrop and pointed to distant movement.

"Mounted patrol," she said. "Not ours."

They crouched until riders passed.

"You see now why I charge more?" Estele asked.

Ksena nodded.

By evening they reached a narrow ravine suitable for hidden camp.

Estele set rules before anyone touched food.

"No high flames. No wandering alone. No talking at full voice after dark."

"You're strict," Ksena said.

"Strict people live longer," Estele replied.

Over dinner, Estele asked casual questions that we're not casual at all.

"So, Ksena, when your ritual failed, did your city panic?"

"They jailed me."

Estele's expression hardened, then smoothed. "Expected."

"Expected?"

"I've seen what your kind does when control slips."

Alcuin looked between them. "Not helpful."

Estele shrugged. "Truth rarely is."

Later, while Alcuin checked perimeter stones, Ksena sat with Estele near the low fire.

"You hate my people," Ksena said.

Estele did not deny it. "I hate what was done in their name."

"That's not the same thing."

"Sometimes it is."

Ksena stared into the coals. "I don't know what my people are anymore."

For the first time, Estele's voice softened. "Good. People who are certain stop learning."

When Alcuin returned, Estele stood and stretched.

"Sleep. We move before dawn."

Ksena rolled into her blanket and watched stars through the ravine cut.

For the first time since exile, they had a direction and a guide.

It did not feel safer.

It felt like they had walked far enough that turning back would kill them faster than moving forward.
