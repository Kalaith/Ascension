He was cute in kind off a rustic backwater way Estele thought to herself, something about him just said to her he would make an ideal mate, he was strong, agile, there was just one small tiny problem Estell eyes wondered to Ksena, he practically seemed stuck to her like an obedient puppy, Estele didn't like ascendant, they were stuck up holding themselves away, and Estele knew something that Ksena didn't, that her people where dangerous, Estele remembered her previous village going up in flames, because they had offended one of the ascendant, and it was only because of her mother hiding her away so the fire couldn't reach her she survived.

Life had not been easy since that point, and Estele anger was bright and flaming, it was tempered and as thin as a needle, Ksena would never know of her hatred, until at just the right moment, they needed an escort and Estele knew this area better than any other tracker, they would need her, she would get paid for it and maybe a bonus on top, Estele's eyes roamed over Ksena to Alcuin, Alcuin felt the stare and turned to face the direction, picking her out of a crowd, she was watching them but why, Estele could see Alcuin enquiringly stare back and took this as her moment to head over to the group,

"I heard you two needed a escort, I am the best around here by far than any of these other ragged adventurer's"

Ksena nodded her head,

"yes we are looking for someone to take us to this location. We heard it was dangerous and we wouldn't make it without an escort."

Alcuin had some doubts about her, and even he could feel her interest in him, but Ksena was blind to it. Estele was attractive and judging by her form, she was likely not even remotely boasting about being the best.

But Alcuin didn't trust her, she had other motives, and he had a feeling that they would regret having her come on the trip with them, even if she was the best but it looked like it didn't matter, Ksena was to trusting and focused on her mission and she was ideal for coming with them, Alcuin sighed as they hammered out payment agreements, Ksena sacrificing some jewels they had found to pay it, He guessed they didn't really need them, and hopefully this trip was quicker with a good guide

"Alcuin I am so looking forward to traveling with you and little Ksena. Let's do our best to get her. There is one piece."

Alcuin sighed, knowing that this would be a difficult time

Estele smiled to herself, Alcuin was wary as he should be and Ksena was as gullible and naive as she looks, they would have a lot of fun traveling together, pocking the gems away, a nice bonus really compared to the prize she was hunting this trip

Ksena was happy they found a guide and a good one so easily, she was defiantly flirting with Alcuin but I guess that's normal, even if she had feelings for him it would never happen, maybe this way she could bury her feeling and focus on what she must do and if Alcuin decided Estele was the one for him, she had no right to interfere, she had already got him exiled from his village and forced him to travel with her, Ksena smiled at the interaction between them even if inside she felt quite empty.

Estele was already proving she was more than the best choice, she had already overhauled their packs, so much so that Ksena had thought she was getting the lighter pack, and it just wasn't the case, Estele had just changed two more bulky items while getting even more items, although she would have to watch Estele flirting with Alcuin at least her mission should go more smoothly now.

Mara sent word through the outpost before noon, and by evening half the traders had gathered near the central cook pit to watch negotiations like it was entertainment. It embarrassed Ksena, but out here everything was business and witnesses made business safer.

Estele arrived with no introduction, sat across from them, and spread six marked bone tokens on the table.

"Conditions," she said.

She pointed to the first token. "Advance payment, nonrefundable."

Second token. "Route control is mine."

Third. "No one touches my gear."

Fourth. "If we split under threat, rendezvous at agreed point, no improvising."

Fifth. "If one of you freezes in combat, the other follows my lead without argument."

Sixth. "If you lie to me about target location risk, contract ends and I keep payment."

Alcuin crossed his arms. "You do this often."

"I do this alive," Estele said.

Ksena set two jewel chips and a wrapped chain on the table. "Half now, half at first temple."

Estele tested each item, then nodded once.

"Accepted."

"You trust us that quickly?" Alcuin asked.

"No. I trust payment."

The crowd laughed.

After the watchers drifted off, Estele remained and asked quieter questions.

"How many know your route?"

"Few," Ksena said.

"Few is too many."

"No names," Alcuin added.

Estele studied him. "Good instinct."

She turned back to Ksena. "Why not hire a full caravan guard?"

"Too visible," Ksena answered. "And too expensive."

"Also too many mouths to control," Alcuin said.

Estele smiled slightly. "You learn fast."

Before they broke for night, she handed Ksena a short, weighted staff.

"Carry this, not just a knife. You're not trained for blade exchanges. Staff gives distance."

Ksena swung it awkwardly.

"Terrible," Estele said. "We'll fix that on march."

Alcuin expected to be insulted next, but Estele only tossed him a spare bowstring and said, "Yours is fraying. Replace before dawn."

At first light they met at the north edge of the outpost. Estele checked boots, straps, water, and ration seals with military precision.

"One last chance to back out," she said.

No one moved.

"Good," she said, and started walking.

Ksena fell in behind her, Alcuin taking rear position by choice.

As the outpost shrank behind them, Ksena felt a strange mix of relief and dread.

They had found their guide.

Now they had to survive what she led them toward.

An hour into the march, Estele ran a quick movement drill while they walked.

"Signal for stop?" she asked.

Ksena raised a fist.

"Signal for scatter?"

Alcuin pointed two fingers down and outward.

"Signal for silence?"

Both touched two fingers to throat.

Estele nodded. "Better. If contact happens, we do not shout names."

"What then?" Ksena asked.

"We survive first. Count heads later," Estele said.

By midday she also corrected their spacing, placing Alcuin rear guard and Ksena center lane to reduce exposure on open crossings. The formation felt strict, but by evening even Ksena admitted they were moving faster with fewer mistakes.

At first camp under contract, Estele made them rehearse emergency breakouts by moonlight.

"If I shout north, you do not ask why," she said.

They ran the drill three times between rocks and scrub. On the first pass Ksena tripped on loose shale; on the second she recovered cleanly; on the third she cleared the route faster than Alcuin expected.

"Good," Estele said. "Panic is training debt. Pay it now."

After drills they reviewed hand marks for map updates. One line meant water found. Two crossed lines meant route denied. A circle meant hold position.

"If we get separated," Estele said, "leave marks only where wind won't erase them before dawn."

Alcuin added his own rule. "Never mark near camp."

"Agreed," Estele said.

Before sleep, Ksena checked her rebalanced pack and realized she no longer missed half the items Estele had removed. She hated admitting it, but lighter gear and stricter marching had already made the journey less chaotic.

"You still think this was a mistake?" she asked Alcuin quietly.

He glanced toward Estele's silhouette by the fire.

"I think she's dangerous," he said. "I also think she's useful."

"Same answer I had."

"Then maybe we're learning."

At dawn, Estele made final adjustments: she wrapped cloth over metal buckles to reduce noise, shifted Ksena's water skin to center mass, and tied a thin warning bell to the rear of Alcuin's pack for night perimeter use only.

"Small details keep people alive," she said.

Before moving out, Estele also set a simple rule for disputes.

"If you two disagree mid-route, we follow the safer option and argue later," she said.

Neither of them liked being told, but both agreed.

The agreement was not friendship.

By the time they left the outpost boundary, all three of them knew the road ahead would test trust before it tested skill.

None of them said it out loud, but each understood this contract might decide who lived long enough to reach the first temple.

No one spoke again until the outpost lights were gone.
