Ksena looked around nervously, keeping low between carved garden walls while patrol routes crossed ahead of her. Sneaking out of the city was forbidden, especially the day before ritual, but she needed to see Alcuin once more.

Tomorrow she would stand in the crystal hall and become what everyone expected. Today still felt like hers.

She slipped through the final corridor and reached the barrier edge. Warm light pulsed over her skin as she stepped through, the city glow fading behind her.

Outside, the world opened immediately. Wind through grass. Bird calls. Real noise instead of disciplined silence.

The village sat beyond the tree line, close enough to trade with the city and far enough to remain separate. Most people in the city called them primitives. Ksena had never believed that.

As she crossed the last rise, Alcuin was already waiting near the path marker, arms folded, trying and failing to look casual.

"You are late," he said.

"You are dramatic," Ksena answered, then smiled despite herself.

He guided her into the village lanes while morning work began around them. Fires were lit, children ran between huts, and no one moved in the measured choreography of the city.

It always felt wrong how quickly she relaxed here.

They stopped near the water trough where they used to meet with Kalani before Kalani's ritual changed everything.

"I kept hoping she'd come back with you one day," Alcuin said quietly.

Ksena looked away. "I did too."

He handed her a small wrapped bundle. Dried fruit, herbs, and a carved token shaped like a bird with one uneven wing.

"For tomorrow," he said.

"You think a carved bird can fix ritual politics?"

"No. I think you'll need something that isn't theirs."

She closed her hand around it.

Before noon, the village elder pulled Ksena aside long enough to study her face and ask one question.

"Do you trust the people who will touch the crystal?"

Ksena did not answer quickly enough.

The elder nodded once, as if the silence said more than words.

By the time she turned back toward the city, the sky had gone hard and bright. Alcuin walked with her only as far as the outer stones.

"After tomorrow," he said, "if you feel different, tell me the truth."

"If they let me out here," she replied.

He gave a humorless laugh. "Then remember this place anyway."

At the barrier, she stepped through first and turned once. He was still standing there, smaller in the distance than she wanted him to be.

When she re-entered the city, the air felt filtered and thin. Patrol bells marked the afternoon cycle. No one asked where she had been.

In her room, she hid the carved bird inside her ritual sleeve and sat in silence until evening curfew.

Tomorrow would not make her safer.

It would make her visible to people she no longer trusted.
